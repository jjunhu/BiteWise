The chicken was tender, soft and melted in my mouth and the sushi was made from fresh fish... One knows it's fresh fish when the its soft and odorless and the colors are bright and deep, which it was and therefore, it was absolutely delicious.

One of my favorite \"fast food\" joints in the city.

Not only is the service fast- the food is absolutely delicious. I've been here twice, and have ordered the lobster roll both times. After my first lobster roll experience, I couldn't resist ordering it again. However, friends did rave about the burger, as well. The cocktails are also very yummy- they have a pretty good selection of beers, wine and specialty cocktails. The interior is also pretty hip and swanky. All in all, a great establishment.
