Seamless-webbing some sushi up for a late lunch, I probably should have been a bit more wary of the low prices on this menu. For $13 I scored miso soup, edaname, salad, 6 spicy tempura tuna rolls and 6 eel avocado rolls. I guess the strangest thing was that the edaname was $5 of that price tag. The rolls themselves were alright, though I would not call the fish \"\"fresh\"\" when it smells fishy. Both were bland and had to be soaked in soy sauce to be edible. The miso was tasty, I liked the little chunks of tofu though some of the seaweed pieces were a little too mushy if ya know what I mean. Service was quick and friendly, but Chimi proves that age old adage true: you get what you pay for... // Don't know how this place got 5 stars on seamless web... The $14.95 dinner bento box was nothing special. Came with 5 pieces of nigiri, a california roll, a weak iceburg lettuce salad, miso soup, and rice. Acceptable, but certainly nowhere near spectacular. Also ordered the tempura red bean ice cream- sounded great, tasted meh. Will order something different the next time I stay late at work! I will say- the delivery was quick though- I work over 20 blocks north and several avenues over from the restaurant, but everything was delivered in less than 30 minutes of my order. // Wow whoever owns this place should be banned from New York. Their listing from seamless got removed because of all of the fake reviews they submitted for themselves. Well... there just happened to be a \"\"new\"\" restaurant that popped up on seamless called Abumi Sushi and it also has over 200 5 star reviews in a few weeks. It just happens to have ALMOST the same exact address. It is 209 E 26th vs. 207 E 26th St. These people are horrible. Please call seamless and get their asses removed. // What I remember about last night*: 7 pm - gonna be a late night at the office. Craving Sushi.
