"<comments> I thought I try Jennifer's Cafe based on the reviews from Yelp. Usually the reviews here are helpful but something went wrong some place. I took a nice little side trip over here from uptown on saturday during lunch time hours. I wanted to try the empanadas that everyone was raving about. Bad idea. Like everyone says they run out of empanadas fast. I order the beef with cheese and the chicken empanada. The ones I got all smelled of old grease and tasted like that way also. It seemed like they never ever changed the oil from when the place first opened up. It was terrible. How can this place get good reviews on their empanadas when they taste horrible. The old smell of grease and the taste of it too is not what I call delicious. I would never go back nor would I recommend this place. <summary> - Keep track of inventory to avoid running out of popular items like empanadas.

"<comments> I got so sick after eating a salad and a juice at this place. I was a goner within the first hour. My friend and I shared the juice and nothing happened to him, so we think it was the salad. The service was good, but what does that matter if the food is not high quality? Maybe it is my fault for ordering uncooked vegetables at a new-to-me place in the middle of winter, but I expected better at these prices in the middle of Bloomie's at one of the most famous malls in the country. So, uh, maybe avoid the salad here. <summary> - Investigate potential issues with the salad ingredients or preparation, as a customer reported getting sick shortly after eating a salad.
- Confirm the quality and safety of uncooked vegetables used in salads, especially during the winter season, as suggested by the customer's mention of raw vegetables and seasonal concerns.

"<comments> Terrible. I feel like I just left the Twilight Zone this place is so dated, and not in the good way. The diner was dark and a little smelly, which is reasonable since it hasn't been updated since the 40s. The food was bland at best, and I had to spit out the home fries. Even the coffee was undrinkable. We both came home with stomach aches. I have no idea how this place is still around, especially with the new ""young professional"" crowd moving in. // Came in based on good reviews here.

"<comments> The parking lot for a Saturday night seemed a little empty...but my groupon expired that day so we went in. There's a lady at the desk in the hall, we thought she was going to seat us? No, apparently we should just proceed inside she said. The bar was large, and the decor for the entire restaurant was beautiful. But alas, the service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter came over hurriedly after 10 mins and asked ""did you order yet?"" We said no. ""Okay what do you want?"" We ordered and he did not return to check on us until our food was wrapped by another server and we were ready to go.

"<comments> This review is more about the customer service-which was horrible- than about the food, which was okay. If you see this restaurant offer a deal here on Yelp or on any other site: buyer beware. I bought the deal here on Yelp: $6 for $15 worth of food. They did not honor the deal, only gave me a $9. discount (because they had to recoup the $6 I paid for the deal???) Then claimed even after they called the manager that they had no knowledge of what yelp even was, and they had certainly never signed up for a deal. I'm still waiting for yelp to give me my $6 back. It's not a lot of money but right is right. <summary> Here are the actionable insights from the customer reviews:

"<comments> I finally stopped in after passing by many times. My hesitation in trying out this restaurant was the fact that most times it seemed empty. Maybe there is a reason why. The decor inside is outdated and could use quite a bit of help. Overall, the food was underwhelming, especially compared to other UES Thai restaurants. In general all the food was lacking in flavor and spice. My Pad Thai was liquidy at the bottom of the dish and the noodles were undercooked and really chewy. The papaya salad was average.

"<comments> Nice service here but, much like nearby Wawa Canteen, patronage should be releaged to harried or lazy NYU students. The falafel/hummus/tabouli trio was fairly priced at $7.75 but was unremarkable. The three falafel were huge but bland and the outside v inside were texturally indistinguishable. Kind of felt like a meatball or matzohball in that regard. The hummus and tabouli were both decent but not worth a special trip.

"<comments> No sandwich could ever be good enough to justify the service at this place.

Never buy any meat in a sauce at this place!! You'll end up with mainly meat flavored sauce and no meat. Then if you ask for meat you can actually see they'll say ""you mean you want extra?"". If you like meat with your rice save your money and avoid this place! Very sad to see this change in meat portions-I do like the food... // Very unfriendly customer service ..
