"Was a huge fan of their Pinto location on Christopher Street location, which had way more Thai focus and less fusion. This new spot really confuses me. As a loyal patron of the former now-closed location, I wanted to like it, and yet this is a place where somehow, everything had something off and wrong with it, and you sit there wondering what the heck went wrong. From the noodle dishes to the crab in a coconut, everything felt over-salted, under, not fresh. The best part was actually scraping the coconut out of the coconut shell - that was delicious! But I could have gotten that elsewhere. Disappointing :/ <|summary|> - The customer misses the Thai-focused menu and less fusion approach of the old Pinto location on Christopher Street.
- There is confusion over the new concept or theme at the current location, which differs from the previous one they were fond of.
- The customer felt that everything tasted off, with specific criticism that dishes were over-salted, not properly cooked, or not fresh.
- Scraping coconut out of the shell was highlighted as the enjoyable part of their meal, implying that it was a unique or redeeming feature, despite the fact that it's a simple pleasure not unique to the restaurant.
- Overall, the customer was disappointed with the experience at the new location.

Actionable Insights:

- Consider re-evaluating the current menu and possibly reintroducing more Thai-centric dishes to align with the successful approach of the former location.
- Review the restaurant's theme and concept to ensure it matches customer expectations and is consistent with the brand's identity.
- Investigate the seasoning and preparation of dishes to address complaints about over-salting and lack of freshness.
- Maintain unique or appreciated features, like the coconut dish, while ensuring the actual content of the food is up to standard.
- Engage with former loyal patrons to understand their preferences and what they valued at the previous location to guide improvements at the new spot."
"I don't eat meat so my review might be skewed since I only had the veggie ramen (the Yasai Shoyu). I thought it was just alright. I can think of a handful of ramen spots with way better veggie options (more vegetables, tastier broth). I also found the noodles here pretty limp, which is a dealbreaker for me. I'm all about springy noodles. There was also kind of a mild burnt rubbery taste to the broth -- could have been the bamboo shoots, though. <|summary|> - Offer more vegetable options and tastier vegetarian broths in ramen dishes to cater to non-meat eaters.
- Improve the texture of noodles to ensure they are springy rather than limp.
- Investigate any unusual flavors in the broth, such as a burnt rubbery taste, which could be related to the bamboo shoots or another ingredient."
"This place sucks. Sneaky additional charge for cheese on a breakfast sandwich. It's listed on the board, but at 3.50 already, you expect it to be included. $2.25 Schweppes 20 oz. bottle. You get the drift. The address says it all. Pure evil. // On a very brisk May day afternoon with the added bonus of my utter and profound nausea mode, I required hot nonalcoholic libation. P.S. Plus Deli provided me with one hot green tea at $2.25 which calm the body. Service is dismay as staff are not the most welcoming but currently is the only deli within vicinity. <|summary|> - Review the charges for add-ons such as cheese on breakfast sandwiches; ensure that any additional costs are clearly communicated and justified to avoid customer dissatisfaction. 
- Review pricing for beverage items like the $2.25 for a 20 oz. bottle of Schweppes to ensure that prices align with customer expectations and market standards.

- Look into the possibility of other nearby delis providing better service or pricing, which could affect your competitive edge."
"I felt a touch claustrophobic in this place. Perhaps I would have been happier had I gotten a juice, but I found the menu to be a bit pricey. I grabbed one of the ready-made wraps for $5.75 and while I was proud of myself for eating healthy, I was sadly still hungry afterwards. Convenient but I don't think I'll be back. // Don't be fooled, the juice is not fresh. If I could give zero I would. I ordered a juice and they mixed some fresh ingredients with old pre-juiced leftovers from an old jar. Also skipped out on many of the ingredients. Never going back. <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews provided, here are some actionable insights for the restaurant owner:

- Consider addressing the claustrophobic atmosphere some customers feel in the restaurant. Look into ways to make the space feel more open and comfortable.

- Review the pricing strategy, as customers find the menu to be pricey. Determine if there are ways to adjust prices without compromising on quality or consider value offerings.
- Assess the portion sizes of your ready-made wraps, as customers report they are left hungry after eating. Consider increasing portion sizes or offering a more filling option.
- Ensure transparency in the ingredients and preparation of the juices as customers believe they are being misled. Honesty in product offerings can lead to higher customer satisfaction.
- Reflect on the overall customer experience and possible reasons why customers might not want to return. Improving customer satisfaction can lead to repeat business.

The reviews suggest that there is room for improvement in terms of product quality, transparency, pricing, and the dining atmosphere. Addressing these points could help in enhancing the customer experience and encouraging repeat visits."
"This is the WORST deli in Brooklyn. Food is OK but the service is shitty. The owners a rude dickhead. Always a different guy cooking the eggs and they always screw up the order. What a disappointment. Go to one of the other hundreds of delis on 4th // The guys that run this place are really nice but they need to learn how to move people in and out of there quickly. Even when there is no one else on line it takes too long to get someone to the counter to ring you up. And the guy they have making sandwiches and eggs in the morning needs a lot more practice. He is way too slow and he overcooks the eggs. <|summary|> - Address the consistency in the preparation of eggs, as there are complaints about orders being frequently incorrect.

"This is by far the blandest pad Thai I have ever had in my life. It tastes like nothing // Wasn't good at all. Pad Thai was a congealed lump, tom yum soup was made from a stock cube, green chicken curry was actually grey (how did they do that?). Better Thai places in the neighborhood for sure. Only redeemable feature was that the delivery guy was friendly (one star for him). I feel bad that he has to deliver such awful food. I'm all for supporting neighborhood joints, and I hope they turn it around. But they won't be round long if they keep serving that up for their customers. Never again. <|summary|> - Improve the flavor of the Pad Thai, as customers currently find it extremely bland and unpalatable.
- Address the quality of the Pad Thai appearance, described as a ""congealed lump.""

"Used to order out sometime untill once I found a cockroach in my lagman soup. Called them about it to at least refund my money for this disgusting experience but they never bothered to even call me back. Poor management and obviously pest control! // The place is conveniently located and the food is USUALLY alright, IF you dine in. If you take out - BEWARE!!!

"Exceeded expectations! ... for wait time. This was a Thursday night with a decent number of patrons. My friend and I were immediately seated upon arrival. All was going well, our first round of drinks promptly arrived, we were looking forward to our appetizers and entrees, and then... Cue a 40 minute wait between the arrival of our drinks and the arrival of our food. We watched patrons who arrived after us already finish their appetizers. Our waiter kept telling us that our order was coming, so we couldn't cancel? To top it off, we were now running late for a show. We asked for the food to-go, got the bill, paid in cash to speed things up, and then waited some more for the to-go order... TLDR; the food turned out to be decent, but the wait was horrendous. <|summary|> - Improve wait times, especially between drink arrival and food service. Customers are experiencing a wait time of about 40 minutes for food after drinks are served.

"Good Yelp reviews, disappointing experience. Eggplant sandwich was okay. I forgot to ask for mayo and mustard on my Italian hero and there was none...I think that's the protocol, but I wish the server would have asked. I wound up not eating it because it was too dry. I did like some of the food on display, but unfortunately didn't order any...great looking mozzarella and tomatoes, and the bread was very good. I was deciding between this place and Sorriso's, which was further away, and sorry I didn't try Sorriso's. <|summary|> - Consider implementing a protocol for servers to ask customers if they would like any condiments (such as mayo or mustard) with their meals to avoid similar situations where customers are left without desired additions.

"I know I am spoiled from my vacation in Italy. I wish I could go back just for the eats. But since I can't, I've been trying to find the ultimate panini place. When I saw that Antico Noe was opening with authentic panini sandwich from Florence, I took the mta during lunch (the lengths I went through!) just to get this sandwich. The place was quaint and small, considering the huge crowd that was there. I ordered the #15 (prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms, and rose sauce) to go. I took my first bite outside the shop. It was good but pretty skimpy on the fillings. The price of the sandwich ($14) was definitely not worth what I got. It was a bit disappointing and a hike from where I work.

"So I wanted to really like this place since I am in love with the location in Montclair. However, unfortunately I didn't. The food was just ok. I normally get the lamb gyro, but at this location it was not prepared well. The meat was not cooked well enough, when it was in the sandwich it was really mushy.

"Sandwiches come from a warming station or are re-heated. There is nothing Express about this place. The cashiers are easily distracted by useless tasks, like refilling napkin holders or lazily scraping banana and strawberries onto oatmeal.

"Came here and was incredibly excited about eating some Ethiopian. After waiting about 25-30 min for my takeout, I was told only cash is accepted. It's 2016, I don't care how hip you are I don't want to waste my time dealing with cash. First you get the cash, is it enough, who knows, lets hit the atm. The cash is counted.

"This is one of the worst Asian restaurants! Am not sure who gave it good reviews, but they probably work here or were comped! The food was plastic and disgusting. The only thing going for it was that the atmosphere at night was passable. We will never ever go here again! We eat at Asian restaurants all the time in the area and this is the worst. Presentation is good, but the food is processed and all third rate. // Ok, so I have a serious bone to pick with this place.

Honestly, McDonalds or Jack in the box have a better buffalo chicken sandwich. Better tasting at least.

"I tried the goat stew. Unfortunately, I was not a fan. It was very gamey, and the flavor was not great. I've had goat stew at Margon and other places and enjoyed it, so it is not because I am not a goat fan. I was disappointed in the price. $9 seems a bit steep for food from a truck. I may have to try it again someday to give it another try. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. <|summary|> - Investigate and possibly adjust the recipe or preparation of the goat stew to address complaints about it being gamey and having a poor flavor.

- Reflect upon the menu description to ensure it accurately communicates the flavor profile of the goat stew to set proper expectations."
"I am very disappointed with the food the taste is bad and the presentation of the plate is not good. The amount that they charge for the kimd of food they have is not acceptable. The waiting time for an order already called in advance is ridiculous. Nothing to do with the quality and taste of the food when they opened this place. They better have to hire a professional cook. // They are way to expensive for a lil restaurant in the middle of no where. There's Peruvian restaurants on Union Ave that are $4-$5 less per item then this place and taste a hell of a lot better and are way more popular <|summary|> - There is dissatisfaction with the taste and presentation of the food; they need improvement.

I didn't copy anything - I printed them all! This little old man starts comparing these sheets up in the light saying that I copied them. FOOL! If I printed three off the same printer, off the same website, would the image not be in the same place?!?!?!?! DO NOT ACCUSE ME!

"Um, no. What McDonalds is to the burger is what this is to okonomiyaki. It's a great dish so there's only so bad it can be - this one was SUPER disappointing. Rubbery and just wrong. Sure, you add the standard toppings and the flavor is akin to the standard dish, but the rest...the slider was horrible 4 parts bread to 1 part meat. The only good thing we had were the yuzu fries.

"They have another location in elizabeth. This particular location has lousy service. Waited forever to get plates, soda and the check.

"We waited almost 40 minutes for food here. The only other people in the entire diner was a party of 8. I ordered a steak sandwich on garlic bread that came with onions and peppers on it. This sandwich was over 10 dollars with tax and it only had 4-5 thing slices of roast beef on it. The garlic bread was not and the cheese was like plastic. My girlfriend ordered a French onion soup and a grilled cheese which were served separately even though she asked they be brought out together. The food was bad and the wait was worse.

"Plain slice was OK, but not super flavorful and unexceptional. Was really looking forward to the chicken roll, but it was -- and I know this sounds counterintuitive to some -- way too big and the chicken was slimy cubes instead of breaded strips. Staff were great, though, and really friendly. Not their fault that they have to work with a bad recipe or cheap ingredients. // My friends and I ordered the Spicy Chicken, Pesto Chicken, and Margarita Pizza with Pepperoni. They were subpar. They were chewy and hard to bite off. The spicy chicken wasn't spicy at all. The only thing that made it spicy was the jalapeos. Margarita was pretty decent and so was the chicken pesto. I probably won't order from there again. <|summary|> - Enhance the flavor profile of your plain slice offering, as it was described as OK but not particularly exceptional.

- Assess the recipes for customer favorites to ensure they meet expectations; the Margarita and Chicken Pesto were singled out as decent, but others may not motivate repeat orders.
- Take into account the possibility that some customers may not return based on their recent experience with the food quality. Consider measures to improve retention and satisfaction."
"Went in today for some Nehari and naan. Came home to find 2 pieces of meat...yes only 2 pieces...in the takeout container. $9 for an order of Nehari with 2 pieces of meat swimming in the gravy! Very disappointing!! The naan was tasteless and burnt around the edges. Will definitely NOT be returning. Wanted to give them a try since it's a new business in town. But never again! <|summary|> - Increase the quantity of meat in the Nehari dish; a customer reported receiving only two pieces in their takeout order.
- Consider reviewing pricing or portion size to ensure customer satisfaction regarding value for money.
- Improve the preparation of naan to prevent it from being tasteless or burnt, particularly around the edges.

"Their Pork chop with rice is good. My only quarrel is that it's quite fatty. But other than the vegetables and seasoning satisfied me. We also tried the oyster pancake which has a strong oyster/fishy flavour. The cold tofu with century egg is light and refreshing. So by the end of our meal we found egg shells in our oyster pancake and so we ended up barely touching it. We tipped them a decent amount despite that. The waiter actually asked us to tip him more. So I deducted another star. <|summary|> - The pork chop with rice is good, but it’s quite fatty.
- The vegetables and seasoning were satisfactory.

"Idk what this is. But I'm POSITIVE this isn't whatever people in the Caribbean actually eat. The starchy dry plantains stuffed at the bottom to pad your stomach tastes awful and the soupy tomato saucy chicken that fills this makeshift banana bowl has no taste...and the guy was fishing around in his bin for pieces of chicken that were about the size as my pinkie nail. The pork cracklings were also worth maybe $0.02, so I'm not sure why they decided to charge $10 for the chicken option ($8 veggie). ...what a waste of money. <|summary|> - Consider revisiting the authenticity and preparation of traditional Caribbean dishes since a customer felt the food wasn't representative of the culture.

- Verify kitchen practices to ensure that food is not being picked from bins, as a customer witnessed this.
- Assess the pricing structure, specifically the chicken option valued at $10 and the veggie option at $8, which a customer felt was not worth the price.
- Consider reviewing the pricing and perceived value of the pork cracklings, as a customer mentioned they were only worth maybe $0.02, yet were priced much higher.
- Reflect on customer expectations of value for money to avoid negative experiences relating to overpricing for perceived low-quality food.

Overall, it is essential to address food quality, authenticity, portion size, and pricing to improve the dining experience and ensure customers feel they are receiving value for their money."
"Great, earnest people. Awful food. It is all swimming in fat and spice, masking poor ingredients. The Kashmiri chai looked was a lurid pink and fatty. The mango lassi was like watered down Dannon yoghurt. The tables were sort of clean. But the worst was the bathroom. It was a slick swamp. A poor place for men. An awful place for women. Seriously, the health department should be called. This is a NO GO, with no second chances. // Terrible place. We ordered for delivery through Eat24 and after over an hour's wait (app estimated 45-60 minutes wait), I called the restaurant and they didn't even get my order. The guy on the phone wasn't helpful and was borderline rude.

"Trek'd all the way to Brooklyn for this, pretty disappointing and I've had my share of dumplings.. It was salty, not enough soup, harder to eat than other soup dumplings, dumpling shell was thin, the soup was lukewarm, and it's EXPENSIVE. It's 3 for $7, which is totally not worth it. The soup tasted like pho but the beef brisket detracted from the experience - did not taste authentic. It's pretty tiny and the dumpling sticks to the aluminum cup. I would rather have pork soup dumplings from Joe Shanghai's any day. Save your money, time, and effort. It's not worth it. <|summary|> - Improve the seasoning of dumplings to prevent them from being too salty.

"If I could give 0 stars I would, but it won't let me. Absolutely, disgusting. I was a customer for a long time until the owner named Rick willingly *admitted* that he served avocado to me that was BLACK with the excuse of: ""Whats the problem? It won't kill you."" You really can't make this up. That was the owners response to me. The avocado was intentionally sliced up and knowingly old, and served anyway. How do you serve that to a customer? I work local to American Melts and we would order as a group once a week at a minimum. Those days are over - as my entire team is just disgusted.

"The food not bad but the service sucks. They always have an attitude and give out a little bit of food. DOnt not go there // Not sure why all the fan fare. Average at best and can be expensive for the quality. // The food is great only if you go and pick the food up. Do not order and asked them to deliver it. Two hour wait poor customer service. <|summary|> - Improve the customer service experience, as reviews indicate it is currently subpar with staff often displaying an attitude.
- Consider portion sizes, as there is feedback about the quantity of food provided being less than satisfactory.

"Your typical deli in Harlem, typical food friendly guys who work there .. found a hair in my bagel once and wasn't to happy about that. But I guess everyone experience is different. They need a little bit of an update in decor since all these other delis have been getting updated. // It's your typical nyc deli. The sandwiches here are surprisingly good. I enjoy the hot chicken cutlet with mustard, pepper jack..add lettuce & tomato on a hero. It doesn't matter the time of day it's always busy. The only down side to the deli is all the people that idle at the store.

"Delivery took an hour and a half. The rice was dry as it if it had been left in a warmer too long and somwhat had a metallic taste from the container. The flavors of the chicken curry and marsala were not memorable. This just was not a satisfying meal for Indian food, which should be all about the flavor carried by tender basmati rice. The mango lassi was delicious, but you get 10 oz for $3. I won't be ordering from here again. <|summary|> - Improve delivery times; a customer experienced a delay of over an hour and a half.
- Address issues with food quality, specifically:
  - Ensure rice is served at the right moisture level and doesn't have a dry texture.
  - Manage food storage conditions to avoid a metallic taste from containers.
  - Enhance the memorability of flavors, particularly for the chicken curry and marsala dishes.

- Take into account that due to their experience, the customer has decided not to order from the restaurant again."
"I ordered a kofta platter and it wasn't cooked properly o sent it back and still wasn't cooked properly. You can see raw red meat. I didn't even touch it after that.

"OVERPRICED!!!!! Same sandwich costs LESS in Midtown Manhattan. Highway robbery! And the owner's a dick too. // I dont love this place. I find them to be overpriced. also, the people there can give off a douchy vibe. // Horrible and dry roast beef. French fries weren't even cooked, they were just cold potatoes.

"Ugh, ordered delivery from BEANS one day after having it catered to a meeting. Thought to myself, hey, I remember that food tasting pretty good. I'm starving. Got myself some mac and cheese that was meh, and something that resembled pulled pork. It tasted so nasty, I literally almost started heaving halfway through forcing myself to eat a little bit. I hate wasting food, but this was so bad I had to throw it out. Never ordering from Beans again. // Ordered from here once, eh, Id rather stick with Pio Pio. Chicken lacks flavour and crispiness. Really not much to write, other than this is just another shot at a chicken restaurant. <|summary|> Actionable insights for the restaurant owner based on customer reviews:

- Review recipes and preparation methods for the mac and cheese to improve taste and appeal, as current feedback indicates it is mediocre (""meh"").

"This place, is in a word,awful. Dry burger,cold bun,stale tomato,limp lettuce. After I got my order I asked for napkins. The girl behind the counter said 'ask him,I ain't got none"" 'Him' being the pizza guy who shares the same place. I can only imagine...looking at the pizza there was depressing -only plain and it looked dry as a bone. Who eats this crap? Awful! Awful meal! I ate there because I was rushed and working nearby. Never again. Terrible!!! // It's closed!!! Went to check it out on November 30, 2014.

Addressing these points may require further investigation into historical problems or clarification that the restaurant has undergone changes since that time."
"Totally disappointed reviews seemed soo awesome tried the food def- not as spectacular as I thought it would be. Rice and beans with chicken was dry not much flavor.

"This is a very small restaurant and looks like a makeshift set up that someone decide to put in their living room. The food is average at best. Very exhaustive menu. We ordered the red curry, the noodles in curry, the vegetarian sausage spread and the spring roll. The red curry was sweet (?) and the rest of the food was nothing great. I would have given this place 3 stars but the really really poor service just brought this place a few notches down. There are two folks serving the entire place. The food was served without cutlery. We had to wait more than 15 minutes before even getting water. Really bad service. Would skip it. Likely will shut down within a year. <|summary|> Based on the summarized customer reviews, here are some actionable insights for the restaurant:

- Consider expanding the size of the restaurant if possible, as customers feel it's very small and resembles a makeshift setup in someone's living room.

- Improve service speed, particularly in serving basics like water which should not have a wait time of over 15 minutes.
- Train the serving staff to ensure that cutlery is provided with all meals that require it.
- Increase the number of staff if needed, as the review indicates only two people were serving the entire restaurant, contributing to slow service.
- Address the poor service more broadly, from long wait times to inattentiveness to customer needs.

Overall, there is an urgent need to improve both the quality of food and the level of customer service to avoid the risk of closure within a year, as suggested by the customer's prediction."
"Dishonest place. For a promotional breakfast by the Belly program they have, they deliberately put American cheese when asked for cheddar, and since it was a take out, it was too late to ask to correct this. Service should be improved so that you want to return. Regretful. The place is close to the house, but would avoid. <|summary|> - Ensure staff understands the details of promotions and accurately provides the correct items as promoted.
- When customers ask for specific items, like cheddar, do not substitute with alternatives like American cheese without confirming with the customer first.

Never going to buy again from here... <|summary|> - Implement a quality check to ensure that the curry chicken is not too oily and is prepared fresh.
- Review the naan bread recipe or preparation method to address issues with its texture, ensuring it's not overly hard or rubber-like.
- Consider reaching out to the customer to apologize and gather more detailed feedback for improvement.
- Look into customer service training to prevent negative experiences that lead to customers not recommending the restaurant."
"Hurry & Tasty thrives on its delivery service as most of its patrons are recipients of their incredibly slow delivery people. Having ordered twice, each had me waiting over an hour to where I didn't even want to tip them. The palak paneer, chicken tikka masala were not only bland but almost downright inedible. I went to the actual place itself and ordered it fresh and was still disappointed. The service has been a bit fast paced and would most certainly intimidate the average Indian food novice. Price wise, not so bad and I figure very few would order if the price were not favorable. Even the most forgiving Indian tastebuds may not be able to forgive this place. <|summary|> Based on the provided customer reviews, here are some actionable insights for the restaurant:

- **Improve Delivery Times:**
  - Many customers have experienced slow delivery, with waits over an hour. Efforts should be made to shorten delivery times.

- **Enhance Food Quality:**
  - Customers have reported that dishes such as the palak paneer and chicken tikka masala were bland and almost inedible. Review and improve the seasoning and taste profiles of these menu items.

- **Consistency in Food Quality:**
  - Even when ordering directly at the restaurant, customers were disappointed. This indicates a possible issue with the consistency of food quality that needs to be addressed.

- **Service Speed:**
  - Service is perceived as fast-paced, which may not be appreciated by all customers, especially those not familiar with Indian cuisine. Ensure that the service pace allows for a welcoming and helpful dining experience.

- **Pricing:**
  - The pricing seems acceptable, but improvements in food quality and service may justify any potential price increase and might dissuade customers from ordering if they feel prices are unfavorable given the current experience.

- **Customer Retention:**
  - The current state of service and food quality might not be forgiving for those with a palate for Indian cuisine. It is important to ensure that the overall dining experience meets the expectations of both novice and experienced customers to encourage repeat business.
  
It's essential to act on this feedback to improve the overall customer experience and retention."
"We've ordered from Bayonne BBQ before. The quality of the food is adequate, but certainly not worth ~$8 for a sandwich or wrap. Tonight, however, was probably the last time we will order from here. The order took 1h38m to be delivered. The food was cold by the time it arrived and was below the usual standards. Bayonne BBQ did nothing in the way of offering an apology or discount for the terrible service when we called. <|summary|> - Consider reviewing and possibly reducing prices; customer feedback indicates that the cost of a sandwich or wrap (~$8) is not perceived as a good value.
- Evaluate the delivery time as an order took 1 hour and 38 minutes which is likely to dissatisfy customers.

- Implement or review customer service policies and consider giving apologies or discounts in cases of poor service to help rectify negative customer experiences.
- Take steps to ensure food quality meets standards even when delivered; complaints of food being ""below the usual standards"" are damaging to the business's reputation."
"Tiny little deli that was super hot inside but the guy working there was nice enough (hence the extra star). They do also carry ice cream (as a sign outside tells you) & it's very easy to find in there. Might be more comfortable inside outside of heat wave days in the summer months. <|summary|> - The interior of the deli may need better ventilation or air conditioning as it was reported to be ""super hot inside.""
- Positive feedback about the staff: The employee(s) present were very nice and provided great service, warranting an extra star in the review.
- The deli offers ice cream, which is advertised outside and easy for customers to find.
- Consider setting up an area outside or improve the indoor space for better comfort during the hot weather, especially in the summer months."
"The food is horrible. Instead of handing us a menu, the waitress asked us what we wanted. I said, ""Can we see a menu?"" and after she brought one with about forty items listed, it turned out we could only order beef with onions and peppers, plantains, or fried chicken. The beef was like bad home cooking, unseasoned, dry, overlooked. And although we were the only customers, our poorly prepared food took forever to come out of the kitchen. Avoid this place like the plague! <|summary|> - Improve the quality and seasoning of the beef; customers find it unpalatable, comparing it to bad home cooking.
- Ensure the menu is promptly offered to the customers when they are seated to avoid confusion and enhance the dining experience.

"I have gone to this stand several times to grab a few chicken sticks to toss into a salad I make at home. There is always a disorganized line happening, where instead of people acting civil by waiting in line, they are jumping in front of people - super annoying... On a few occasions, I have grabbed undercooked chicken sticks - usually associated with there being a mob outside the truck. I get it Franky... you are busy... but please... COOK YOUR MEAT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. You are gonna kill someone. (Thankfully I never eaten a stick on-the-go, I chopped them up at home and pre-consumption notice the undercookedness. Anyways, go if you want to... but be warned that they get rushy with their cookin' <|summary|> - Address line management to prevent queue jumping and ensure orderly customer service.
- Establish processes to ensure all chicken is fully cooked to prevent serving undercooked meat.
- Pay attention to busy periods to improve food safety and customer satisfaction.

"Got the spicy chicken. ..it was a huge let down. Too much spice and not enough other flavors. I'm not even sure the meat was chicken. It had a strange blackish color to it. . . Not a fan & I do not recommend. // Smells really good, big portions, quality is mediocre. I ordered the bulgogi platter. It came with rice, bulgogi, a small salad, and 5 dumplings. It also came with a bowl of soup thing, with some square thing that looked like a chunk of tofu. Overall, I just didn't think any one thing tasted awesome, although the bulgogi was pretty good. The dumplings and soup were not that great. Maybe go for the bulgogi sandwich instead? <|summary|> - Consider adjusting the spice levels in the spicy chicken dish to balance the flavors and ensure that chicken remains the dominant taste.
- Review the cooking method or presentation of the spicy chicken to avoid any strange colors that might lead to customer confusion about the meat type.
- Take into account the negative feedback on the spicy chicken dish and determine if the recipe or presentation needs to be changed.
- Examine the quality and taste of the bulgogi platter components, especially the dumplings and soup, as customer feedback suggests that they were not enjoyable.
- Maintain the quality of the bulgogi since it received a positive remark, suggesting it could become a highlight of the menu.
- Keep an eye on portion sizes and ensure they are consistent with customer expectations for quality.
- Since there's a suggestion to focus on the bulgogi sandwiches, you might want to consider any potential for menu expansion or special promotion of this item. 

Please note that these insights are based on individual customer opinions and should be weighed against other feedback to inform any decisions."
"this place is shit, but not because of the food. it takes 35 years for food to come & the nachos r stale, but besides that, the servers ARE CRAP. well to be fair, ive been served by two lovely women in the past. But this one girl... oh my god. shes the worst. Shes rude and unwilling to help, ive asked her before about the food and she wouldnt tell me what the plates are. she even got my moms order wrong, and we wanted a new plate, and she said ""well eat it"" like wtf???? get a manager? give us another plate? idk anything but that. will never go back for that one server. fire her honestly.

- Investigate and address complaints about long wait times for food to be served.

- Evaluate the particular server who received the negative review for possible retraining or reassignment.
- Maintain the quality of popular items like tacos, beans, and rice, as they are appreciated by customers despite service issues."
"The steaks were small, tasteless and tough...anyone living near a butcher would be out of their mind to order meat from here...the hamburgers were equally unremarkable, reminded me of the old ad ""where's the beef!"" This was a real disappointment! // I ordered online. How far can one company dip? It has been about 3 yrs since I ordered lasr and everything was terrific from the steaks, chicken breasts, hotdogs, stuffed potatoes, etc. Received an order 2 wks ago, the chicken was stringy and rough, it was all thrown out. The steaks are tough, the hamburgers have no taste at all. I would rather go to McDonald's for a burger and I never go there. They won't be hearing from me again. <|summary|> - Improve the quality and size of the steaks; customers find them small, tasteless, and tough.
- Review the quality of the hamburgers; there are complaints about them being unremarkable and lacking in flavor.

"I went to Espresso 77 on a Sunday afternoon and there was only one person sitting inside, who left shortly after I got there. I soon found out why. After ordering a chai and sitting down to read a book, the two employees began a loud conversation complaining about management, hours, really anything they could whine about. Then when another customer came in and wanted 2% milk he got major attitude for not wanting 'regular' milk. To top it off, the chai was made with a powdered mix that wasn't even mixed well into the drink. It felt like I was drinking sand. I won't be going back. <|summary|> - Ensure that sufficient staff is available, even during slow periods, to avoid giving the impression of an empty restaurant to arriving customers.

"I figured I'd give this place a try. I love soup. I went there at 10:30am 12/30/15 and they were closed? Are they out of busines or was I to early? <|summary|> Here are some actionable insights from the customer reviews:

- Verify and potentially update the hours of operation posted online and on the storefront to ensure they are accurate and prevent customer confusion.
- Consider opening earlier if there's demand for it, as at least one customer attempted to visit at 10:30 am.
