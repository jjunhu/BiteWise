"<comments> I know I am spoiled from my vacation in Italy. I wish I could go back just for the eats. But since I can't, I've been trying to find the ultimate panini place. When I saw that Antico Noe was opening with authentic panini sandwich from Florence, I took the mta during lunch (the lengths I went through!) just to get this sandwich. The place was quaint and small, considering the huge crowd that was there. I ordered the #15 (prosciutto, mozzarella, mushrooms, and rose sauce) to go. I took my first bite outside the shop. It was good but pretty skimpy on the fillings. The price of the sandwich ($14) was definitely not worth what I got. It was a bit disappointing and a hike from where I work. I probably won't go out of my way to go. <summary> - Consider adding more filling to your panini, as a customer found the sandwich (#15) skimpy on fillings.

I've ordered from Ohba Asian Fusion several times in the past and was disappointed every time, not sure why I continued to order from there again.

I got the 2 baos (pork belly + peking duck) with popcorn chicken combo for $13.06 with tax included...portion was just right. However, the baos were just ok...nothing special.

I cancelled my order because of that. // Poor service, expensive food were the two major turn offs. The food quality...

Give a cash discount rather than penalizing people who don't carry cash. // I'm so confused about this place. I expect for the staff in any place that is supposed to be healthy to know what they are serving people. I couldn't get a straight answer out of one of the girls on what exactly were the additives in the smoothie (that I was charged practically $10 for). Every time I eat a salad I end up feeling weird. Go to the little coffee shop next door. <summary> - Review the establishment's policy on credit card minimums and examine the way customers are informed about it and how staff is trained to handle the situation; customers find the enforcement of this rule to be rude and it may be driving loyal customers away.

I had a carnitas burrito and my roommate had the chipotle chicken. I really wanted to like this place - small business, fun decor, staff was fine. The burritos just had no flavor.

"<comments> Disappointed, unfortunately. Downtown Ise was so much better. It looks that they tried to upscale the restaurant; looks good, but food are so-so. You will know how many customer they are having (not many). You do not even need reservation. Fish quality is not as they put the price for. Their market price Sashimi was NOT good. So Americanized how they cut the fish! Fat isn't always good, we want quality. Even grilled fish (Hokke) was not flesh enough (Japanese can tell by the smell). Drinks are limited. Soba noodle is good, yet, Soba dipping soup isn't. Over all, there are so much better place with less money. If you are only going there for the noodle, it could be acceptable.

"<comments> Couple months ago, I bought some pork jerky from this place one time - it was very tasty; moist and flavorful. So needlessly to say I wanted more of it, just that I haven't had the time to venture to chinatown to buy more. So fast forward, I came here again with couple friends. Bam, right there behind the glass case housing the jerky craws a little cockroach. a 2 inch COCKROACH. I told the guy behind the counter - hey you have a cockroach with your jerky. He looked at me as if it's business-as-usual. // Not what I remember it to be :( I remember going in 2009 and it was sweet and tender. This time around, the pork jerky was wayyyy too tenderized and was almost mushy. The beef was much better and actually had a bite to it. <summary> - Maintain the quality and consistency of the pork jerky, as it was once praised for being very tasty, moist, and flavorful, but a more recent experience described it as overly tenderized and almost mushy.

"<comments> I get the idea that Church Bar underwent a change recently. After reading all of the great reviews, I decided to check it out with some friends. They had hibiscus drinks on the menu which was interesting, but other than that, this place didn't have much. Very small selection of liquor, no food options (although we were allowed to have food delivered), and in desperate need of a renovation. It felt like more of a restaurant than a bar; it didn't seem like a place to get drunk.

"<comments> Celebrated my friends birthday at the restaurant. We had a party of 16 people, two people were violently sick with vomiting and diarrhea and two including myself had stomach cramps nausea and upset stomach for two days. The food portions where very small, even the beat salad which hardly costs anything to make was only enough for half the table.

"<comments> I was craving ramen and stopped in here since I was hungry and in the neighborhood. I ordered the beef miso ramen. I enjoyed the bamboo and pickles in the ramen, but there was no runny egg in my bowl as often is the case at other ramen restaurants.

At this price point, I would rather go to one of my favorite ramen spots in the East Village. <summary> Based on the customer's review:

- Consider offering a runny egg option in ramen dishes since this guest missed it and it seems common at other ramen restaurants.

The egg was a little overcooked and there definitely could've been more bacon.

"<comments> Four of us (two couples) came here for dinner on a Saturday night, the main reason being that they served Bercelona style food. Unfortunately, nothing about their food, including patatas bravas, was Barcelona like. The food was merely average, service was OK and the atmosphere below average. Yet the prices were above market level. I expected better, especially given the average reviews. I won't be coming here again. // ""GLASS EN LA COMIDA"" The food was bad. The place is nice. We had a piece of glass in our food and walked out. There's no love in this cooking or their wine selection. Just upscaled prices for what looks like would be a promising place. Had these sentiments prior to finding the piece of glass but that really left us speechless. <summary> Based on the restaurant customer reviews provided, here are the main insights that could help improve the restaurant experience:

- **Authentic Cuisine Claims**: Customers came with the expectation of experiencing authentic Barcelona style food, particularly referencing patatas bravas, and found that the dishes did not meet this expectation.

- **Value for Money**: Customers perceive the prices to be high, particularly in comparison to the quality and authenticity of the food delivered, indicating a discrepancy between price and value.
- **Service Quality**: While not heavily criticized, the service is described as just ""OK,"" suggesting there is room for improvement in making the service more memorable or exceptional.
- **Atmosphere**: The atmosphere is considered below average, which could impact the overall dining experience negatively.
- **Safety Concern**: There was an incident of glass being found in the food, which is a serious health hazard and indicates a need for stricter quality control in the kitchen.
- **Menu and Wine Selection**: There seems to be a lack of passion reflected in the cooking and the wine choices available, suggesting that the menu could be revitalized and the wine list curated more thoughtfully.
- **Reputation and Expectations**: There is a discrepancy between customer expectations, influenced by the restaurant's reputation or market positioning, and their actual experience. This needs to be addressed either by managing expectations better or improving the offering to align with those expectations.
- **Customer Retention**: At least one customer has explicitly expressed the intent not to return. It is crucial to investigate what factors specifically led to this decision and address them to improve retention.

Actions for consideration could include:

- Reviewing and updating the menu to ensure that the food is authentic and high-quality.
- Re-evaluating pricing strategy to reflect the quality and authenticity of the food and enhance perceived value.
- Enhancing staff training to improve service levels.
- Making atmosphere improvements for a more inviting dining experience.

"<comments> *Delivery review* Ordered the Toro Dynasty roll via Seamless. Delivery was relatively timely, but was quite honestly disappointed in the quality of their most expensive special roll ($19). Wanted to try this place for the longest time but the toro salmon and toro tuna was lackluster and the rice was quite clumpy and hard, unlike actual sushi rice. Also charged $1 for extra ginger and gave a tiny little container. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing but given the pricing I had expected a little higher quality.

"<comments> Came here for a late lunch and was expecting a great meal because of all the awesome reviews. The place was pretty much empty when I got there, but I wasn't really surprised at that since it's winter time and it was very close to 3 pm already. Service was really attentive. The waitress filled my cup with some warm broth right away. However, the broth wasn't really that good and I asked for some tea/water instead. Ordered the spicy cold noodle with raw fish. Sauce on cold noodle was way too sweet and severely lacking in sesame oil. The whole thing was extremely disappointing.

"<comments> I ordered delivery with a variety of sushi and rolls. The fish is terrible! It was not fresh, smelly and disgusting. Near the end of my meal I ended up just eating the rice because it was so bad. The only thing that was decent was the eel. Their rice has an overpowering amount of lemon juice in it. I wouldn't eat here even if it was free, let alone for the price I paid for it. I only eat at cheap sushi places and this is the worst sushi I ever had. Additionally I live super close to the store, like 10 min walk tops and it took over an hour to get my food. // The worst service you can ever get it took 40 mins extra to deliver ans the send the sushi without soy sauce // Terrible service, with cold food and slow delivery. <summary> - Address and improve the freshness and quality of the fish used in sushi and rolls.

We ordered the red curry, the noodles in curry, the vegetarian sausage spread and the spring roll. The red curry was sweet (?) and the rest of the food was nothing great. I would have given this place 3 stars but the really really poor service just brought this place a few notches down. There are two folks serving the entire place. The food was served without cutlery.

"<comments> I have gotten takeout from this place like 3 times since it has opened. The first time, I ordered rolls that had raw fish. Particularly, I got spicy salmon rolls (my favorite) and alaskan rolls. The spicy salmon was bland and the salmon in the alaskan rolls tasted odd. Perhaps the salmon not being fresh could be an explanation for the odd taste...? But after the first time, I learned that it my best bet would be to stick to california rolls and such because you can't possibly F those up right? So the other two visits I made were strictly for ""cooked"" rolls. Overall, this place is just meh.

"<comments> The ambiance is cafeteria-like. Very bright and lifeless. You walk in with the expectation of waitress service and instead your asked to order at the counter. It's not a bar and at the same time, not much of a restaurant. The food was subpar, lacked flavor, and was very salty.

"<comments> I had 2 orders of mozzarella sticks and their menu had said six pieces per order at 4 dollars each. It was a bit pricy but since I was craving them I was okay with that. But when they were delivered, each box only had 5 so I called them to let them know, only to the have the owner place the blame on the company that prints out their menu. In principle, he could've let me know beforehand since he seemed to know about the misprint or he could have fulfilled what his menu had advertised by simply adding a SINGLE mozzarella stick to each order. What got me mad was that he was arguing with me, failed to accept responsibility and did not issue an apology.

"<comments> Awful! I don't like anything about this place besides the paint job. Heading into Famous Gyro World, you would think that they are experts at making gyros. The pita was burnt and the ""lamb"" slabs were barely heated through so there was none of that tasty browned meat action. This atrocity was unforntunately topped off with bitter onions, soggy tomatoes, and oxidizing lettuce. More tzaziki sauce, PLEASE!

"<comments> We ordered the Imperial Bing (which is the Peking duck one). You can choose soft vs. crispy and we ordered it crispy, but either they gave us the soft version or the crispy is not remotely crispy... Not very much duck inside and what little there was was mostly skin and fat... there was one part where I could still see some feathery nubs or something so that freaked me out. I definitely understand that Peking duck generally does have lots of skin and fat and is somewhat expensive, but I would rather have paid twice as much and gotten some of the good, meaty parts than what we had. I liked the apple and cucumber slaw part. As an aside, I think it's funny / sad that they have to use French / Spanish words of ""crepe"" and ""burrito"" to describe it. <summary> - Ensure that when customers order dishes like the Imperial Bing (Peking duck), they receive the version that they requested (soft vs. crispy).

The food was ok (after waiting for almost an hour for dinner- anything seems to satisfy me). But the food was nothing amazing tbh. I've had better Turkish food elsewhere with better hospitality. NEVER coming back here. // Horrible customer service I've ever encountered in Astoria! The waiter was super condescending and rude. We waited two hours for our food and they even got our order wrong.

"<comments> Pretty meh. I'm obsessed with French things so figured i'd check it out. On the early side of when it opened, so maybe things are better but I wasn't too impressed. It's trying to be a mix of sports bar and French wine bar I think, but it doesn't really work. Wine was fantastic, can't knock it for that. Service was ok. Got some food, including a meat/cheese plate. They had run out of a lot of things, had to keep repeating our order, and when it came out, it was a huge board with very minimal food on it for $18.

"<comments> First of all you said after 20 minutes of waiting that the vanilla ice cream machine is refreshing but i still didnt get the vanilla!!! So i dont understand why i waited 40 minutes. Second of all i heard about some credit the first time here! Also delivery guy had my full address and phone number. Do not lie to your customers!!!! // Smoothie was not so good fruit was not fresh, I did see a help wanted sign maybe with more help they could do better. I really hope so. // Went in for some frozen yogurt and left empty handed. All the fruit toppings were so freezer burned that they all had ice crystals on them. This was around 8pm. Why isn't there fresh options? Even then, why are they still frozen later in the day? Meh, no thanks. <summary> - Review 1: Complaint about waiting 20 minutes and then an additional 20 minutes without receiving the desired vanilla ice cream due to the machine being refreshed.

"<comments> Maybe this passes for quality Mexican out in Rockaway. This place wouldn't stand a chance in Ridgewood, Sunset Park, or Flushing. I had an al pastor burrito (marinated and grilled pork) it was almost tasteless- no fresh salsa, bad sour cream, it was also really moist and watery. Not good things in a burrito. Also, the waitstaff seemed off in their own world, I tried speaking with them in Spanish when I ordered, they acted annoyed that I even tried. It was all in all a bad experience. Won't be back. I suggest looking further down in the 90's for decent sit down restaurants. Or drive out of Rockaway when you want quality Mexican. <summary> Based on the provided customer reviews, here are some actionable insights for improvement:

- Examine and enhance the flavor profile of dishes, particularly the al pastor burrito which was reported to be tasteless.
- Review the quality of ingredients, including potential issues with fresh salsa, sour cream, and the overall moisture content of the burritos to ensure they are not watery.
- Improve customer service training, as staff seem unengaged and annoyed when interacting with customers.
- Consider staff language training to better accommodate customers who attempt to speak Spanish.

- Reflect on the current standing of the restaurant in comparison to competitors in areas like Ridgewood, Sunset Park, and Flushing to identify what improvements can be made.
- Acknowledge and address the feedback that customers are suggesting to drive out of town for better quality Mexican cuisine.

Taking these steps may help to enhance the overall dining experience and encourage customers to return. </summary>"

Their house special fried rice and even regular fried rices used to have EGG and sprouts in it with green onion and peas... now you only get onion in your fried rice.

It seems like they refuse to change the oil there cuz the chicken is dark brown and dry now, when it used to be golden crisp, plump and yummy. I'm not ordering from there again, what's the point if the other person behind the wok doesn't give a who-ha about the person who worked for about 3 hours to earn that 5 minute meal. <summary> Actionable insights based on customer reviews:

- Review the cooking oil change schedule to ensure the quality of fried foods, such as chicken, isn’t compromised. The chicken previously described as ""golden crisp"" is now ""dark brown and dry.""

"<comments> Not sure why this place has such great reviews. I NEVER leave reviews, but my experience ordering from this place was really subpar. I ordered something directly off of their menu on seamless (ie., just clicked it...). It came within the delivery window, but didn't have all of the ingredients. I called, they wanted to send over the missing ingredients? I mean, make a new sandwich... I can assemble my own without tipping you. The correction arrived 40 minutes later and was STILL incorrect. When I called to address the problem, the person who answered the phone argued with me that he had ""put everything on"" the sandwich, including things that are not listed.

"<comments> Probably worst food experience I've had in a very long time. I ordered delivery from here. Delivery man - was rude, did not greet me. I said good night and he didn't look at me, he just out the order in my hand and turned around. We had 2 meals the plantain & cheese balls and the fried pargo. Platain cheese balls - big and bland. Needed spices and more cheese. I couldn't finish it because of how bland and dry it was. Friend largo - the fish itself was good, but could have been seasoned more. The rice was good but too much was served. The plantains were again very bland, had no salt or adobo. I would never eat here again, at least not from delivery. <summary> - Review the delivery service interaction and ensure delivery personnel are trained in customer service etiquette as the customer experienced rudeness.

"<comments> I normally don't write any reviews on yelp, but this place is SO BAD that I feel obligated to warn others. They must be crazy if they think this is place is going to work. The prices are outrageous. $25 cheese plate had literally 4 slices of processed cheese cut into triangles, and on the side we got a couple of Ritz crackers fresh out of the box. The white wine we ordered came close to room temperature. One star because I don't have the option to give zero. Beware.

"<comments> I'm a bit confused as to what this place is trying to be. They say they bring food and drink from all over the globe but all 24 beers are from NJ (not that I am not into supporting our state, it just doesn't fit with their supposed vision).

"<comments> Okay so they close at 7PM but stop baking cheese balls and all at 6PM. For the last hour of business, there were just a few of their famous cheese balls left to purchase. The nice guy at the sales counter reheated the remaining cheese balls for me. But, they aren't so good reheated. I wanted to like this place (lots of great reviews) but these cheese balls were too salty, not cheesy or ""gummy"" in that unbelievably good chewy way. And, they shouldn't sell mediocre goods at the end of the day. Or, sell them, but at a discount.

"<comments> I went here to grab some breakfast after a night out. Wasn't looking for anything fancy, just a nice spot to chill. Although the location is prime (right next to Johnson Library on Main St.), I didn't feel my order was very good. The sausage, egg, and cheese on a bagel I had was sub-par at best, mostly because of the chewy bagel and fake-tasting eggs. And the coffee tasted burnt and off brand.

I ordered the fish and shrimp tacos. I asked for the fish, and shirmp to be grilled but had gotten them fried. All the taco had was the fish, a little bit a coleslaw and a tomatoe. Which was kinda disapointing, and flavoreless. You can add hot sauce and tartar sauce for some flavor. You can barely taste any seasoning, all I could taste is the fryer they probably used to cook the fish and shrimp in. For my first experience I was very disappointed especially after reading these great reviews but I will give it another try.

- The overall impression is that the restaurant's food, aside from the rice, lacks the authentic flavors and preparation methods a customer would expect from this cuisine, which may not be a concern for those indifferent about flavorless food.

Actionable insights for the restaurant:
- Assess and improve the cooking technique for the jerk chicken to align with traditional expectations.
- Review the cooking process and seasoning for the ox tails to ensure tenderness and balanced saltiness.
- Maintain the quality of the rice dish, as it was well-received.
- Consider collecting more feedback to see if these issues are recurring and take steps to improve overall food flavor and authenticity.
- Communicate these concerns to the kitchen staff and possibly retrain to ensure authentic Jamaican culinary methods are being applied.
- Reassess customer satisfaction metrics to ensure the restaurant meets the cultural cuisine standards patrons expect. </summary>"
"<comments> I am happy to see that such exotic cuisine is available to experience. I was not impressed though. The quality of food was not what I had expected. Getting takeout was a challenge when I saw no description of the dishes on the website and when I called in I got a very vague description of what I would be ordering. A friend of mine drove this to me on her journey from NYC and when I opened the package I saw a very different picture than what was described to me. I am all for using all part of the animal and trying new things but what was described to me as simply beef leg turned out to be a cartilage dish. It was shocking to say the last and a better warning and description could have cleared up the confusion. <summary> - Consider describing dishes more accurately both on the website and when providing explanations over the phone to match customer expectations.

"<comments> Family stopped in and had the thin pork belly and kalbi.....yeah ok, banchan was good and the pork belly was decent, but the kalbi they brought out, already cooked was so chewy my kids had to spit it out after chewing and chewing and chewing.... horrible never going back. I paid $34.99 for that plate of leather like kalbi. // The service was good. Side dishes were good, but their bbq was so bland. I'm used to marinated meats! <summary> - Consider improving the quality and tenderness of the kalbi, as it was too chewy and caused negative experiences for children.
- Price review might be necessary; a customer felt that $34.99 for a plate of tough, leather-like kalbi was not a good value.

"<comments> Been a few months since I've been there. Went back for the mini-Tipica (that's the small version of the Bamdeja I described on my earlier review) and boy has the quality control dropped out. One half slice of maduro (fried plantain a that's 1/4 of a banana) the THINNEST slice of beef and and chicharron (pork rind) I've ever seen in my life, an unripe slice of lime... BOO! I won't be going back anytime soon! <summary> Based on the customer review:

The lady was nice though so I feel bad but screw that. I cannot act like it was even close to what other Yelpers wrote. I cannot believe this place was a 4star on yelp! <summary> - Consider revising the menu for clarity and cleanliness; it appears to have been confusing and perhaps not well-maintained.

"<comments> Overrated ramen joint in midtown east. Food: 1.5 Ambiance: 3 Value: 3 Service: 3 Overall: 2 Stopped by based on Yelp reviews and have never been so disappointed in fellow Yelpers. I ordered the white kakuni ramen and some takoyaki on the side. The ramen was over-salted and flavors were muddled. There was no depth of flavor that I was looking for, only saltiness. Also, the bowl was loaded with raw onions which I'm not used to and it overpowered all the other flavors. The takoyaki was ok but not great. The flavor was fine, but the middle was way too mushy to be good takoyaki. Overall, I was very disappointed. The ramen competition is fierce in the area so try one of the others. Totto is three blocks away. Otherwise, you'd probably get better ramen out of a package. <summary> - Improve the balance of seasoning, particularly reducing the salt level in your ramen, as customers find it too salty and overpowering.
- Consider revisiting the flavor profile of your ramen to add depth and prevent a muddled taste, as customers are looking for a rich and distinct flavor experience.
- Review the quantity of raw onions used in dishes to avoid them dominating over other flavors, as not all customers are accustomed to or enjoy them in large amounts.
- Evaluate the takoyaki side dish's quality, particularly the texture, as feedback suggests it's too mushy and could be improved.
- Take note that the local competition for ramen is strong; explore what differentiates your ramen from others and leverage that in your offerings to attract customers.
- Potential customers are relying on reviews from platforms like Yelp; consider managing the online reputation more actively by responding to feedback and showcasing improvements made.
- Look into other successful ramen joints nearby, such as Totto which is mentioned and only three blocks away, for inspiration and to understand what might drive their popularity. </summary>"

"<comments> Overall, the banquet sitdown dinner was good and the service was satisfactory. BUT. The owner is clueless. She promised to close the restaurant for us (on a Wednesday afternoon, when the restaurant is supposedly closed anyway) and then went back on her word and said she can't turn people away if they show up. Umm, why the heck not? We had a large group of elderly guests - over 90 years old. On the way out, they were walking out very slowly. Because they're ELDERLY and had walkers.......... The owner is standing at the back of the restaurant screaming ""Close the door, I have the AC going!!""

The other day I came in and orders half a chicken, fried yuca and a flan. The flan was amazing, the chicken was okay, the yuca was disgusting! Sooooo sooooo disgusting!

Rice was dry, meat was meh, salad was measly, the person didn't even fill up the box all the way with rice or meat and it has a strong fragrance to its food. Felt like I was eating perfume.

"<comments> Absolutely atrocious service. I've never had a more horrendous experience with management. Never going back. // $7 dollah hookah. $5 strawberry/banana smoothies. Complete that with mozarella sticks and fries. And of course, good company. The quality of the hookah isn't as good as the ones I've had (may be attributed to its price). The drinks and food were great though. They have a room inside the place that's dark and full of music and young high school kids, all sitting on old flat sofas and couches.

We also tried the oyster pancake which has a strong oyster/fishy flavour. The cold tofu with century egg is light and refreshing.

"<comments> The menu for this sushi place looked very promising, but I never received the order because their delivery person seemed unable to find my building (prominently marked business address in Midtown). I wasted about an hour between waiting for the delivery person, who insisted he was there, and calling the restaurant to explain to them that he was *not* there. The restaurant owner kept trying to convince me that the delivery person was indeed there--very frustrating conversation. They could have simply sent someone else instead of trying to convince me he was there and I was just stupidly not seeing him.

"<comments> Came here for a quick lunch. I got the Liang Pi (cold skin noodles) $5 and the Chinese pancake $4. The noodles were ok but don't compare to Xians famous foods. The Chinese pancake was not good. First off it was difficult to eat - I wasn't sure if I should eat it like a sandwich or carve it up with knife and fork. It falls apart. In addition, it wasn't very flavorful and the iceberg lettuce and fried noodles didn't enhance anything. Definitely a pass on the Chinese pancake - although it was entertaining watching them make it. On the positive side, the lady at the counter is nice and willing to take orders in English. There are definitely other choices at this food court. <summary> - Evaluate the quality and taste of the Liang Pi (cold skin noodles) and possibly compare with that of local competitors (e.g., Xian's famous foods) to ensure they meet customer expectations.

"<comments> Ordered via Seamless for some sushi on a Saturday. Got the cucumber, avocado and asparagus roll with miso soup (and clear soup for the next day). The roll was good- nothing special but it's also a simple roll in and of itself, so that was to be expected I suppose. When I went to eat my miso soup, however, there was a huge, long black hair in it...gross. There are few things that trigger my gag reflex but hair in food is one of them, especially considering that this soup likely came out if a larger pot that people ate from all night. Just disgusting.

"<comments> Ok, so clearly the people who are reviewing this place have never had a decent ""platter"" or ""burger."" I was so excited that we finally have a platter/gyro joint around the area, but I must say this is only worth it when your all out of options. The burgers and platters seriously need some more depth and flavoring and the prices badly need to be reduced. The drive to Juicy Platters in Fairlawn or New York (for real street food) is seriously considered before coming here. // Had a rock in my lettuce, needless to say I will not be eatting there anymore.

It was so dry,cold and full of fat. I can't even call it a shawarma. It looked so old over the stick but I said let me give it a try and it was the biggest mistake.

"<comments> The actual name has the word Magic in it, which adds awesome points. Standard pizza place. The pies are fine, typical, not great but normal. The crust on the pizza is pretty good though, and sometimes I will stop in just to buy some dough, which they will sell you for $3, and go home and make my own pizza. I had a salad from them once, and it was pretty gross--it was basically the toppings for a hamburger, with iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles!

"<comments> Chicken is a bit dry and overcooked. Although it had a nice flavor for me the texture and juicy factor is important.

"<comments> Super average food. I've had much better bandeja paisas elsewhere, especially for the price they charge for the mini size. The arepas were forgotten with our paisas, but when they came out they were extremely stale. The empanadas were nice though, and very fresh. Maracuya was average, and the service was subpar.

Then when another customer came in and wanted 2% milk he got major attitude for not wanting 'regular' milk. To top it off, the chai was made with a powdered mix that wasn't even mixed well into the drink. It felt like I was drinking sand.

I mean they are halal but that merely means the muslim equivalent as saying kosher. Anyways, like a lot of these other carts that get a cult following, I think this is 90% rep and 10% substance.

The white sauce has a strong dill flavor which I was not expecting but wound up enjoying, tempered by the decent heat in their hot sauce. Also enjoyed the sauteed onions they add instead of raw, but still the grease was off putting enough that I will most likely not be back. <summary> - Ensure that onions are thoroughly cooked, as customers have received raw onions.

"<comments> Close to GCT on park ave, it def caters to a business crowd. Stumbled upon this place while walking back to our hotel and thought we'd give it a try. There were mostly only bar seats available and so ended up sitting there, weird arrangement of sorts and slightly difficult to watch the tv if you're interested in a game. Got the steak tartare, which didn't remotely taste anything like it and felt there was too much aioli that took away the taste of the steak. Drinks are pretty overpriced too, guess its prob coz of the location and the crowd. It's probably better to come here for brunch and they have half off on their wine bottles which is a great deal. Not sure if I'd come here otherwise on a weekend night as such. <summary> - The restaurant's close proximity to Grand Central Terminal makes it attractive to a business crowd.
- Customers may accidentally find the restaurant while walking, suggesting it might benefit from increased visibility or signage.
- Seating seems to primarily consist of bar seats, which might be a disadvantage for customers who prefer traditional table seating.
- The arrangement of the seats and the TV makes it challenging to watch games, indicating a possible improvement in layout for better viewing.
- The steak tartare is reported to be overwhelmed by too much aioli, which masks the taste of the steak. This suggests a need to adjust the dish's recipe or presentation.
- Drink prices are considered high, which might be attributable to the restaurant's location and client base. Potentially, prices could be reviewed to ensure they are competitive with nearby establishments.
- Brunch offers a better value with a half-off deal on wine bottles, hinting that similar promotions could be applied to other times or menu items to increase customer satisfaction.
- The reviewer is uncertain about the appeal of the restaurant during weekend nights, suggesting that the atmosphere or offerings might need to be more enticing for the weekend crowd. </summary>"

I am a Dobbs Ferry resident and I won't return. // I was really disappointed in this place. Like other reviewers I waited about 35 minutes for a so-so panini that was very greasy. Smoothie was ready quickly but place is not well managed. Order wasn't communicated to the person making the sandwich until about 20 minutes when there was an a-ha moment and they realized. Person who ordered after me was served before I was. Also it is quite expensive for what you get and I'm sure there are better options nearby. I'd avoid it. <summary> - Address long wait times of 35 minutes, even during non-busy evenings.

"<comments> Just horrible because the food isn't served on time and the servants are rude. Plus that the people that cook the food probably dropped some hair in the food since I found hair in my food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone // Terrible restaurant. Beef stew was watery and came in a small portion for an entree. The white rice and beans on the side seemed devoid of seasoning. The peril which is a staple of any Latin restaurant didn't have much of any flavor at all. When a Latin restaurant can't get rice and beans and pork right they should take some time to re-evaluate themselves. To top it all off the they didn't have any water.

"<comments> Idk what this is. But I'm POSITIVE this isn't whatever people in the Caribbean actually eat. The starchy dry plantains stuffed at the bottom to pad your stomach tastes awful and the soupy tomato saucy chicken that fills this makeshift banana bowl has no taste...and the guy was fishing around in his bin for pieces of chicken that were about the size as my pinkie nail. The pork cracklings were also worth maybe $0.02, so I'm not sure why they decided to charge $10 for the chicken option ($8 veggie). ...what a waste of money. <summary> - Consider revisiting the authenticity and preparation of traditional Caribbean dishes since a customer felt the food wasn't representative of the culture.

Will definitely NOT go back. // I had teriyaki and takoyaki at so many different japanese places, this is the worst I ever had. I don't know what kind of ingredient they use to make the skin of the ball but I am sure it is not flour. Dislike. <summary> - Ensure food is served at the appropriate temperature; there are complaints about cold food.
- Improve the flavor profile of the dishes; customers have reported a lack of flavor.
- Reevaluate offerings at Madison Square Park's food vendors due to negative feedback about not wanting to return.
- Investigate and potentially improve the recipes, specifically for Japanese dishes such as teriyaki and takoyaki, as there are claims of them being the worst ever tasted.
- Review and confirm the ingredients used for preparing dishes, particularly the outer skin of takoyaki, which the customer suspects is not made with regular flour. </summary>"
"<comments> Took like half an hour to get a simple fried chicken sandwich. When I got home, bit in only to find that although I had specifically ordered a chicken breast, it was a thigh and I'd just bitten into bone. Admittedly, it wasn't bad fried chicken, but who orders a chicken thigh sandwich with bone in it? They also forgot to put any tomatoes/lettuce on it. It was just fried chicken and cheese between two slices of store bought wheat bread. The two people who worked there seemed old and confused, like maybe they weren't all there, but very nice. Maybe it's time to hire some younger folks to run the place? <summary> - Improve service speed; took too long (half an hour) to serve a simple fried chicken sandwich.
- Ensure order accuracy; a chicken thigh was given instead of the requested chicken breast, and it contained bone.
- Review the sandwich construction; forgot to add tomatoes and lettuce.
- Consider bread quality; used store-bought wheat bread that may not meet expected standards.
- Staff training; the two employees seemed old, confused, and potentially not fully present, although they were described as very nice.
- Evaluate hiring; suggestion to hire younger staff to bring new energy and possibly improve efficiency. </summary>"
"<comments> Not happy with this place....super over priced and extremely small portions. I would not recommend this place unless you are looking to get ripped off. I was excited to try this place and was very disappointed. // I was shocked when I received my chicken entre, the portion was so small, I thought I was at a Weight Watchers restaurant! // Went to this restaurant to try their Rosh Hashanah menu. While they did offer many small courses, the food was not good. The soup had no flavor, the main courses were okay but the desserts were inedible. The choices were bread pudding or baked apple. The baked apple was an apple slice with some sort of crumbs on top.While the bread pudding looked like a miniature blondie. I think they tried to put a new twist on traditional foods but failed. <summary> - Customers feel the restaurant is overpriced with small portion sizes.
- There is a recommendation not to dine at the restaurant unless willing to overpay for less.
- One customer was excited to try the restaurant but ended up disappointed.
- Complaints about the chicken entrée portion being too small, to the point where it felt more appropriate for a diet program.
- The Rosh Hashanah menu did not meet expectations as the food quality was lacking.
- Specific feedback notes that the soup had no flavor, while main courses were just okay, and desserts were inedible.
- Dessert options were limited to bread pudding or baked apple, and the execution of these was not satisfactory, with the baked apple being overly simple and the bread pudding looking unimpressive.
- There is an impression that the restaurant attempted to modernize traditional foods but was unsuccessful in doing so. </summary>"
"<comments> I was in this place 3 times, after 1st I would not come back, but I was invited to attend party .I have number of issues. 1. Twice when we ordered lamb shish kebab, they serve pork and lamb, I prepare lamb shish kebeb at home, and know how meat should look, lamb never is light (it is red meat, and turn dark whet it is well done, or stays red for medium) 2. My husband had lamb chabs twice within a month and portion 2nd time was a lot smaller. I would not come back <summary> - Problem with meat orders: There have been instances where lamb shish kebabs were ordered, but pork was served alongside the lamb. The customer has experience with preparing lamb shish kebabs at home and noticed the lamb served at the restaurant does not appear as typical lamb meat should (lamb meat should be red and turn dark when well-done or stay red for medium).
  
- Issue with consistency in serving size: The customer's husband received lamb chops twice in a span of a month, and the second portion was significantly smaller than the first.

Based on these points, here are some actions you might consider:

- Review the sourcing and preparation methods for lamb dishes to ensure that only the specified meats are served as per the menu's promises. Mislabeling or mistakenly serving the wrong kind of meat is a serious error that should be corrected immediately.
  
- Investigate potential problems in the kitchen or supply chain that could lead to inconsistencies in portion size. Staff should be trained or reminded about the portion sizes to ensure consistency for every customer.

- Evaluate staff knowledge and training, specifically regarding meat identification and handling, to prevent future mistakes in serving incorrect meats.

- Consider implementing a quality control system to maintain consistency in serving sizes and food quality.

- Reach out to the customer to apologize and offer a solution or compensation to address their poor experience.

- Ensure that all customer feedback is reviewed regularly to identify and rectify recurring issues. </summary>"
"<comments> Brunch party - not child friendly. Accidentally ended here looking for brunch with the family and they had a brunch party with live DJ. Place seems great but not for families with children. // Our group made a reservation for lunch months ahead of time. When we arrived, the staff was courteous, but barely there. From the time that we entered to the time that we got our entrees was over two hours - at least one of these hours passed after orders were put in. We won't be back. // Had the skirt steak and salad....let's say I could have done a better job. Was not impressed, if I go back it will be to have a few drinks at the bar which seemed to be serving some good drinks. <summary> After analyzing the separate customer reviews, here are the action points I have distilled:

- Evaluate the restaurant's marketing and environment to ensure that it is accurately portrayed as either child-friendly or not. The current brunch party atmosphere with a live DJ may not be suitable for families with children.
  
- Review and improve the reservation handling and overall customer service. Customers who have made reservations should not be made to feel neglected, and staff presence should be consistent.

- Address the timeliness of food service as there are complaints about over two hours of wait time from entrance to receiving entrees. This might involve streamlining kitchen operations or better managing customer expectations.

- Assess and possibly enhance the quality of the dishes served. Feedback for items like the skirt steak and salad was negative, with a suggestion that even customers felt they could do a better job.

- Consider focusing on strengths, such as the bar area which has received positive notes about its drinks. This could potentially become a unique selling point for the establishment. 

These insights should be incorporated into management strategies to improve the overall customer experience. </summary>"

- One day received the wrong order.

- Implement or improve a customer service recovery strategy to address and resolve issues effectively.
- Monitor and follow up on customer service interactions to ensure they meet satisfaction standards.

"<comments> This place was horrible!! I ordered a $7 order of pancakes, sausage and eggs. An extra order of pancakes for my sons a bagel with cream cheese. Don't know who the cook was. The bagel was burnt. Sent back and the pancakes out some box, Aunt Jemima' ready made taste better, were also overcooked. I complained and the manager had the nerve to say they were fine and come like that. I guess he's oblivious to Yelp. Should have gotten the gist when walking into an empty place at peak time. Stay away. // Came here for breakfast with my son. The pancakes were horrible. I agree that anything from a box would have been better. Ordered scrambled eggs and sausage and the sausage had a weird after taste. This place is cheap but the food is not good so I would go anywhere else! <summary> - Monitor and address food quality issues, as customers complained about burnt bagels and overcooked pancakes, which suggests a problem with kitchen staff performance and/or supervision.

- Enhance the staff's responsiveness to complaints. A customer reported dissatisfaction with how the manager handled their complaint, implying that customer service training may be necessary.
- Re-evaluate food pricing in relation to quality. Despite being low-priced, the food did not meet the customers' expectations for quality.
- Look into the occupancy levels during peak times, as a customer indicated surprise at the restaurant being empty, which may point to a larger issue with the restaurant's reputation or marketing.
- Use feedback from platforms like Yelp to improve, as one customer suggested that negative reviews were not being taken seriously. </summary>"

- Reevaluate your restaurant's atmosphere, as it negatively impacted a customer's dining experience.
- Ensure the cleanliness and upkeep of both the restrooms and the eating space are maintained regularly.
- Despite a low star rating, acknowledge that vegetarian options seemed satisfactory to a customer.
- Address concerns regarding excessively greasy and oily food, which not only affected the presentation (dyed bowls yellow) but concerned a customer about their health.
- Explore ways to provide better value for money, as one review suggests paying a bit more elsewhere for higher quality food is worth it.
- Acknowledge a positive comment about the service, but balance it with the need to improve food quality and healthiness, particularly for vegetarian options.
- Consider offering healthier vegetarian meals that are less oily to meet expectations of health-conscious customers. </summary>"

As soon as I walked in with my date everyone stared at us and continued to do so until we left. <summary> - Consider installing a working ATM or allowing for additional payment methods beyond cash-only transactions to accommodate customers who don't carry large amounts of cash.
- Investigate noise levels to see if there are ways to create a more cozy and inviting atmosphere for customers who are looking for a quieter, more relaxed experience.
- Evaluate the vibe of the restaurant to ensure it's welcoming to a diverse clientele, not just those who enjoy hip-hop or a party-like environment.
- Train staff to provide a welcoming experience to all guests, regardless of their appearance, to avoid situations where customers feel uncomfortable or stared at. </summary>"

"<comments> Yeah, I concur. This pop up concept is disappointing. We ordered pretty much everything available and unfortunately everything came out semi-cold which makes me think they do a big batch of cooking and then just serve as people come in. Thank god we ate a (pre) dinner at Porsena while waiting for space to open up at Lakh Lakh. // $7-$8 persian-inspired plates of ridiculous portions - you'd have to order 4 per person in order to feel remotely full! 3 tablespoons of persian lamb stew for $8 (without any rice)??? It's absurd. <summary> - Improve food temperature upon serving; customers are experiencing semi-cold dishes, suggesting a disconnect in timing or food holding practices.
- Examine the batch cooking process to ensure food freshness as this may be impacting customer satisfaction related to food temperature.
- Evaluate the pop-up concept as there is feedback indicating disappointment with the overall experience.
- Consider menu pricing and portion size; customers are noting that the prices are high considering the small portion sizes (highlighting Persian-inspired plates costing $7-$8).
- Review the value proposition of the dishes, as the guest mentioned the need to order multiple plates per person to feel sufficiently full.
- Address the specific issue with the Persian lamb stew pricing and presentation—they are expecting rice included for the price of $8.
- The problem of space and waiting times might be indirect feedback, as the customer ate elsewhere while waiting for space to open up at your establishment. Consider improving the waitlist system or customer flow.

- Address the quality of the beverages served, such as ensuring tea is not bagged Lipton and that coffee is not burnt or watered down.
- Investigate the possibility of creating a more comfortable and conducive space for customers who wish to stay, sip their coffee, and get work done, as the current setting may not support this experience.
- Manage customer expectations by clearly advertising the restaurant's concept and offerings to avoid misleading those looking for a traditional cafe experience. </summary>"

Today I got a simple California roll and shumai. In the sushi you could taste that the crab was fake, also me and friends ate the same thing and have the worst stomachache. Since they're not so busy and there's never anyone in there I feel like they use old fish for their food. Not impressed :( <summary> - Monitor and improve sushi quality, as the initial positive experience has declined over the weeks with multiple reports of low-quality sushi.
- Investigate the freshness and source of the fish, specifically salmon and tuna, to ensure they meet quality standards and adjust if necessary; customers reported the salmon color as too red and complained about the taste of the tuna.

It was more of a peanut butter cookie than the usual baklava's that I've had (and trust me I've had a lot). It was good, but just not a baklava for me. Maybe in old Jerusalem they loved their peanut butter. <summary> - Consider exploring regional preferences or updating the menu to meet customer expectations, as one customer was disappointed with the familiarity of the flavors and mentioned having better experiences in smaller towns.

"<comments> I started coming here on days when Esparks was too crowded. I'm slightly disappointed each time I come. The wait for a sandwich is usually ridiculously long because there is only 1 guy manning the cash register and making the food. Even an pre-made falafel from the refrigerated section took about 15 minutes to heat up. My lunch break was usually half over by the time I started eating. They make really cheesy sandwiches on their greasy grill. But it will literally take 20 minutes of awkward standing around to get your plain ham and cheese. And then you realize you're paying $6 for a sandwich and coffee when you could get a bigger, healthier sandwich with coffee for nearly 2 bucks less. The AM radio is also usually blasting staticky news if you like that sort of thing. <summary> - Customers experience long wait times for food due to only one person manning the cash register and preparing the food.

The third (and final) time I tried the place, it took them 20 minutes to get me their basic egg sandwich. The reason being that they handed my sandwich to some pasty hipster chick who fit the look of clientele this place is obviously catering to.

"<comments> Been here one time. The atmosphere was okay at first. Drinks are way to expensive, especially this side or town. $15 for a soco and coke is just wrong, especially when you will pay less than half that at the bar next door. The staff I found to be rude and pushy. If you are not planning on continuously adding to your tab, they treat you like crap. Also heard about the sisters or mercy party that la lune canceled on at the last minute. Not surprised, and we can take our business elsewhere. // I wish I could give this establishment less than A single star. The manager is as dishonest and vile as they come.

"<comments> Came here and was incredibly excited about eating some Ethiopian. After waiting about 25-30 min for my takeout, I was told only cash is accepted. It's 2016, I don't care how hip you are I don't want to waste my time dealing with cash. First you get the cash, is it enough, who knows, lets hit the atm. The cash is counted. The cash is counted again when being put into the register. Needless to say I walked out starving. It's not 1992, guys.

Today I came in and my fiance wanted to get a really large tilapia fish and they didn't have it, they only had regular size one, the salad is horrible..I usually get the fish sandwich which is four bucks, they pay music here generally mainstream Spanish music, this is not necessary, but wished they played more variety. <summary> - Explore ways to improve the perceived ease of cooking and offer dishes that might seem more complex or unique to enhance customer experience.

"<comments> This place seems like it's out of business but still manages to hang on somehow, rarely anyone goes there a lot now but I did the other night. I ordered 9 piece chicken and I told the guy I didn't want wings because well they would do those cheap skate things and give me 7 wings probably and 4 pieces of actual thighs and breast etc. After I said that he charged me an extra $1 which I did not get why I have to pay more for something that clearly says 9 piece chicken for $11. How cheap. <summary> - The restaurant appears to be struggling with low patronage, as suggested by the comment on its seeming out-of-business status and the observation that few people visit it now.

On both occasions I went at 830 pm on week ends and they said they are closed. The chef was sitting outside on a break. It's completely their prerogative on when to close the shop but atleast update your timings accordingly so that customers are not mis guided. // We eat a falafel sandwich and chicken shwarma sandwich. The falafel balls were nice but the let down was the pita. The size of the sandwich was also nice.

"<comments> I don't find this place to be anything special. Food was very salty. I ordered #18 and the sauce tasted like ragu tomato sauce. It was mostly a rice portion with a side of stewed beef and iceberg lettuce. Overall, expensive for $14. By the way- their guacamole has no tomatoes. It does have egg boiled egg. I do not recommend. The Salvadoran cheese does not taste like feta as advertised in their menu. Also, I originally order a cheese pupusa and they didn't have. Ended up with a mixed bean and cheese. I don't feel like they make them fresh like other Salvadoran delis I have visited. I would go to Ranchito Deli or El Vincentino Restaurante Salvadoreno or venture into Queens Village. Their horchata is water-based not milk based. <summary> - Review the salt levels in dishes; customers have found the food too salty.
- Reevaluate Menu Item #18; particularly, assess the sauce to ensure it is distinct and not reminiscent of generic ragu tomato sauce.
- Consider adjusting the portion size of the rice and enhancing the accompanying side items for better value, as the current $14 price point was perceived as expensive by a customer.
- Reassess the ingredients in the guacamole; customers may expect to see traditional ingredients like tomatoes rather than substitutions like boiled eggs.
- Inspect the taste and advertising of the Salvadoran cheese to ensure that it meets customer expectations and aligns with the menu's description, specifically the feta cheese claim.
- Review inventory and menu accuracy based on the unavailability of cheese pupusas; ensure that items listed on the menu are in stock or remove them temporarily if they cannot be provided.

- Investigate alternatives to milk bases in drinks like horchata if current offerings deviate from traditional recipes, ensuring that descriptions are accurate to customer expectations.

Overall, the review indicates dissatisfaction with the food's authenticity, taste, and value for money. This suggests that improving ingredient quality, recipe authenticity, and menu accuracy could enhance the dining experience. </summary>"
"<comments> I ordered the chicken Greek salad based on a previous review. The chicken is hard and overcooked. The salad is soggy. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because they were quick. It was $7.50 - not super cheap - definitely on the cheaper side - but I guess you get what you pay for. // Grrr.....I miss Jimmy. This place isn't the same w/o him. The new guy standing in his spot seems like he could be a nice enough guy but he's not Jimmy. The feta on my Athena chicken wrap tastes sour...or maybe it's the tzatziki but something is off. I had to toss it in the trash. Also, I don't think they have that delicious Greek salad anymore. I didn't see it at the counter. <summary> - Address cooking issues with the chicken to prevent it from being hard and overcooked.

"<comments> This place is just okay, nothing special, nothing outstanding. Their specialty is supposed to be the Rotisserie chicken and although it's inexpensive, it is ridiculously over-salted, almost inedible. And the green Peruvian Aji Sauce is very bland and flavorless. If you want real Peruvian Rotisserie chicken and a dynamite sauce, go to Pio Pio in Queens. There is no comparison. And they are CASH only, nothing online, minimalist setup, not worth it unless you're really, really hungry. Because they do have large portions, just disappointed in the chicken. <summary> - Review the level of seasoning, particularly the salt content, in the Rotisserie chicken to ensure it meets quality and taste standards.

- Be aware of the customer's opinion that the restaurant is only a viable option for those who are very hungry and not specifically seeking a standout dining experience. </summary>"
"<comments> Oil change! WD -40 ! Unfortunately thats what I felt like I was encountering when I ate here. I had calderetta which was soaked with oil, fortunately not to the point of seeing my reflection.

"<comments> I was really excited when this place opened up, but really disappointed with the sushi. The rolls were mostly rice, and they were falling apart. On one side of the roll it was seaweed paper and the other a ball of rice. There was hardly any fish in the rolls. It was almost as if the person making the rolls had never done it before. I really wanted to see this place succeed, and I hope you take my criticism with stride. I would love to turn this review into 5 stars. I would recommend hiring a good sushi chef. // Very small portions and average food for such expensive prices. I'm a petite female so I don't eat much; but this was so underwhelming/disappointing.

I ordered the same thing again the next day. They confirmed they have it and will be ready in 5 minutes. 20 minutes later and after missing a train they told me that they will take another 10 minutes and I had to cancel again. <summary> - Train staff on menu awareness; ensure all staff know what items are available before taking orders.

"<comments> $6 dollars for 5 chicken momos. The dumplings were not very big, especially for that price. Although the dumplings were nice enough the taste wasn't anything to write home about.
