"I pass them nearly every night, and I admire them for their presence adding a little variety to the late-night food truck scene behind halal carts and tacos. Finally gave them a try, though, and was woefully underwhelmed. I was handed a chargrilled heap - black from the griddle and tasting of smoke more than anything else. You get sour cream on top, but it's doled out from a dressing bottle in a conservative fashion that hardly covers the large portion size. It's cool they're made to order, and I get that all of this is maybe just their ""style,"" but don't come expecting this to be a convenient Westside answer to Veselka. It's not. <|summary|> - Consider adding more diversity to the late-night food options to compete with local food trucks such as halal carts and taco stands.

"First of all you said after 20 minutes of waiting that the vanilla ice cream machine is refreshing but i still didnt get the vanilla!!! So i dont understand why i waited 40 minutes. Second of all i heard about some credit the first time here! Also delivery guy had my full address and phone number. Do not lie to your customers!!!! // Smoothie was not so good fruit was not fresh, I did see a help wanted sign maybe with more help they could do better. I really hope so. // Went in for some frozen yogurt and left empty handed. All the fruit toppings were so freezer burned that they all had ice crystals on them. This was around 8pm. Why isn't there fresh options? Even then, why are they still frozen later in the day? Meh, no thanks. <|summary|> - Review 1: Complaint about waiting 20 minutes and then an additional 20 minutes without receiving the desired vanilla ice cream due to the machine being refreshed.

"The staffers were a mix of clueless and deceptive in their evasive answer whether it's related to Bosie Tea Parlor in the West Village (it's not, but is related to another Bosie bakery uptown), which is interesting because the selection is very similar. Here, they stock an odd cabinet of sweets on the right with different stuff than the tiny, absurdly priced items in the glass display (tiny mille crepe cakes, broken and/or underfilled macarons, etc.). Darjeeling Macaron was a bad way to drop $2.50, and the samples handed out at the door didn't impress either. <|summary|> - Provide staff with additional training to improve customer service skills, focusing on reducing perceptions of being clueless or deceptive.

"I was dying to try the beef patty with cheese and pepperoni. But I after seeing the guy handling money pizza the mozzarella cheese with his dirty hand I change my mind. If you decided to eat at this place please make sure the employees washes their hands first. // We did a 5 borough pizza day and this was just an ok slice of you happen to be walking in the area.

"Absolutely atrocious service. I've never had a more horrendous experience with management. Never going back. // $7 dollah hookah. $5 strawberry/banana smoothies. Complete that with mozarella sticks and fries. And of course, good company. The quality of the hookah isn't as good as the ones I've had (may be attributed to its price). The drinks and food were great though. They have a room inside the place that's dark and full of music and young high school kids, all sitting on old flat sofas and couches.

"Food is pretty average quality and a bit pricey. Half the time whoever's preparing my food serves it with a nice side of 'tude. There are slightly better options nearby. // CulinArt is a step ahead of the previous vendor (Sage) in regards to the TC cafe, however with all these new fancy additions they lack on simple things. You can't get a veggie side you must order the whole hot meal. No small side salads anymore. Pricing isn't often available at the cashier if you order something off of main menu.

"I recently moved to NYC from Chicago and was craving some Mexican food. I checked out Yelp and Grubhub for reviews and with these outstanding reviews for Out, I figured what could go wrong?

The delivery was terribly slow and took an hour and 40 minutes after our initial order. The tacos were dry and flavorless. The empanadas? Dry and flavorless. What a disappointment.

Same meal will cost you $1 to $2 more at Sophies and other places. // Beware -- this greasy sandwich place has an $8 lunch special and a $10 credit card minimum. <|summary|> - Improve the accuracy of online orders by ensuring all available items are updated in real-time to prevent customer wait times after ordering.

"On a recent trip from JFK, I had quite a wait before my flight home. This place was right at my gate so I thought I'd get a coffee from a place called a Cafe. There were 4 of the cafe employees sprawled out over the chairs for passengers doing everything but working. The one lady behind the counter told me she did not have any coffee and dismissed me. Not satisfied with her answer, I asked the lazy employees gossiping on the chairs behind me how it was possible that they did not have any coffee. The reply was ""We have coffee, we just ain't making it."" Nice. Save your money and try one of the other nearby cafes in the terminal.

"I needed a couple of pies for my daughter's birthday. I owned a business for 20 years locally and learned how important customer service is. I was happy to see you were busy. After waiting on line for 15 minutes the server apologized to me explaining that there are no deliveries today. Undaunted, I said no problem, I'll take your number and call in an order later. I called in my order only to be told ""I'm sorry sir but we are not taking phone orders"". If you're busy then staff appropriately.

"$6 dollars for 5 chicken momos. The dumplings were not very big, especially for that price. Although the dumplings were nice enough the taste wasn't anything to write home about. I finished them and was still hungry and I'm not a big eater. Would not go again when there are so many tastier and bigger options on the same block. <|summary|> - Review the pricing of the chicken momos, as a customer felt they weren't a good value for the price ($6 for 5 chicken momos).

I didn't mind when they got the order wrong but I wish I could have liked the food more. // First, I was not impressed by the Grecian Cave in the least. It's food is basic and lackluster while the prices were a bit high for what you got. Although others love this place. I ordered the cliche turkey club on wheat. A little less than $10 later with a side of fries (I guess they just came with the sandwich), I went back to my office. It was just that cliche sandwich with oil soaked fries. Just not work it.

"Okay so they close at 7PM but stop baking cheese balls and all at 6PM. For the last hour of business, there were just a few of their famous cheese balls left to purchase. The nice guy at the sales counter reheated the remaining cheese balls for me. But, they aren't so good reheated. I wanted to like this place (lots of great reviews) but these cheese balls were too salty, not cheesy or ""gummy"" in that unbelievably good chewy way. And, they shouldn't sell mediocre goods at the end of the day. Or, sell them, but at a discount. The Coffee Shop Bar (Union Square West and 16 Street ) does these Brazilian Cheese Breads better than anyone else in NYC. I'm heading back there... <|summary|> - Extend the closing hours beyond 7 PM as customers are interested in purchasing items near closing time.

"I've had breakfast here a few times and it's been pretty good. I got a sandwich today and the lettuce was brown and the bread has a stale taste.

I'll probably give them another shot solely because of convenience and lack of options in the area. <|summary|> - The customer has visited the restaurant multiple times for breakfast and generally finds the food to be pretty good.
- However, they had a negative experience with a sandwich where the lettuce was brown and the bread tasted stale.

"Not a Fan. We went here for coffee in the morning and were very disappointed. I ordered a carmel latte and was very surprised when they pulled out a bottle of coffee maid creamer instead of using carmel syrup. The coffee was then in turn room temp because they added A LOT of the cold creamer to it. I asked her to warm it up since it was cold and she just added some more milk which really didn't make much of a difference in the temp since not much more would fit in the cup. I also ordered Banana bread and it tasted old. <|summary|> - Address the quality of caramel lattes; consider using caramel syrup instead of creamer to meet customer expectations.
- Ensure coffee served is at the right temperature; avoid using excessive amounts of cold creamer that can make the beverage too cool.

"This place isn't very good. We had plantains (gluey), Pastors (lots of fatty chunks), and chicken tacos (tender, serviceable flavor, but also very generic). The portions are large, which I genuinely appreciate - $4 doesn't buy you much taco at other places in this area. In general, I would say this place is okay if you're hungry and in a rush. With Gueros and Kimchi Taco both right nearby, there isn't much other reason to eat here. // Food is good, delivery is fast but I just got charged an extra 5.25 for cheese and sour cream for each taco even though I told them to not give me the lettuce.

"Yikes. Though not terrible, there will never be an order from these guys again. The $23 sashimi dinner had slices so small they had to fill the rest of the plate with a lump of rice. I might be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure sashimi isn't usually served with a side of rice...on the same plate. Serious waste of cash there. Spinach dumplings are served with a strange neon pink sauce which tasted odd. Salad was served without dressing. You get the point. Unless this is your last option, don't even make it an option. <|summary|> - Portions seem too small, specifically mentioning a sashimi dinner where a lump of rice was used to fill the plate, which is not typical for sashimi servings.

"Ordered the spicy Cajun chicken sandwich and it was the worst sandwich I've ever eaten. Completely drenched some Asian chili sauce in the sandwich and was way too salty for any human being to eat.

Certain grill guys will fight with you because they dont wanna cook anything <|summary|> - Review the recipe and preparation of the spicy Cajun chicken sandwich, particularly the sauce's salt content, as a customer found it inedibly salty.

"How can this fucking place stay in business? it's a snow day and they aren't delivering? They also have a $20 minimum for delivery. What kind of bullshit is that? They're closed at least on Monday and Tuesday they almost never pick up their phone. When I called today to ask for delivery the chick that answered just said hi not hi this is Pho 888 or anything else. I had to say is this the restaurant? It's in a shitty part of town and if they're not gonna deliver how my ever going to know if the food is worth getting or not? <|summary|> - Evaluate delivery policies and consider remaining open or providing delivery during snow days to meet customer expectations; possibly communicate any weather-related service changes proactively.
- Reassess the $20 minimum for delivery, which might be considered too high and could be deterring potential customers.
- Ensure the restaurant is consistently answering phone calls to avoid losing business and frustrating customers.

"Whatever you do don't get the bun noodle salad.. it's so bad. Sauce was sugar water and the noodles basically had bahn mi toppings on top: carrots and cucumbers. Writing this as my stomach is bloated and feels weird. I hope they improve the quality of the food, I so badly want a good Vietnamese place in the neighborhood. But otherwise don't go here. // If you don't mind eating food made in a gross environment, you wouldn't mind it much.

"This is not too bad place for dining. However, the reason I gave 2 stars is because it is more like Chinese styled grill. The sauce they use and the way they cook rice and noodle, it is just so Chinese. I love Chinese food but i expected japanese style grill. Disappointment.. but had a pretty good time .. // The food was okay with the typical but shortened ""performance"" while the cook was being cooked. Rice was soggy and the food has tons of garlic. I asked the chef not to throw the veggies into my mouth; however, he did it anyways. That was a bit rude. Also, the seating arrangement was very tight unless you sit on the two ends. You are basically shoulder to should with whoever is next to you which is very uncomfortable. <|summary|> - Consider clarifying the restaurant's cuisine style in marketing and signage to set accurate expectations; customers are mistaking it for a different type of cuisine (expected Japanese grill but found it to be more Chinese-styled).
- Address the cooking method and ingredients (particularly the use of garlic and the way rice and noodles are cooked) to cater to customer preferences for less traditional Chinese approach if the restaurant aims to offer a more diverse Asian cuisine.
- Provide training for chefs on customer service and personal space boundaries, as there was an incident where a chef threw veggies into a customer's mouth despite being asked not to, which was perceived as rude.

"The actual name has the word Magic in it, which adds awesome points. Standard pizza place. The pies are fine, typical, not great but normal. The crust on the pizza is pretty good though, and sometimes I will stop in just to buy some dough, which they will sell you for $3, and go home and make my own pizza. I had a salad from them once, and it was pretty gross--it was basically the toppings for a hamburger, with iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles! Also, there is a crazy, long stingray stinger hanging from the wall, which is really strange, I love it. <|summary|> - Highlight the unique name ""Magic"" in the restaurant's marketing to capitalize on the positive association with the name.

"Absolutely absurd pricing for very average food. If there prices were in line with the quality - they might have a fighting change but $36.00 for an average piece of halibut - come on. $36.00 is utterly absurd. I agree - don't waste your money. Will NOT go back! // Overpriced Greek restaurant, with 16$ drinks, loud music to the point where you can't talk, average food, and average staff...your call if you want to give it a try. <|summary|> - Review the pricing strategy, as customers find the current prices too high for the quality of food being served (specific complaint about a $36.00 halibut).

"I had teriyaki chicken to go. It was horrible. The chicken tasted like wood. The veggies were good. The sauce was like chinese food brown sauce. Not going back to this place unless everyone I am with makes me (I work across the street). It was also really expensive - ten bucks!!! // The design team did a great job. A lot of thought and effort went into making this place aesthetically pleasing. And it is, but what good is that if they serve up the worst pad thai I have ever had?

Order bottled beer and watch dust doesn't fall from the fans // It's ok. I wouldn't go back. I'm not to fond of their steak seasoning.

"The candela has been a fabulous play in the past but tonight I don't know If I will ever comeback.They had a party going on consisting of over 20 people , they had kids screaming at the top of their lungs, their balloons going on our table and them reaching over to grab it. The irrisponsible parents were drinking dancing yelling too. People were entering and leaving in 5 minutes.

"Good neighborhood restaurant. Friendly service. Good choices. My only complaint is that they seem to overcook everything.

I could not believe my ears when I heard that. When he proceeded to ask for parmesan cheese on his pasta, the waiter angrily removed the spoon from the cheese bowl and dumped at least three quarters of the bowl onto his pasta.

"This is the worst diner I've ever been to. Chipped plates, my pancakes taste like onions, my bacon is soggy (how is that even possible ?!?) , home fries are more like tasteless mashed potatoes. The best thing is the ice water.... Please avoid this place and just drive up the road to IHOP if you're feeling like some pancakes. // Needed a place that was open 24hours after a late night of drinking in Far Rockaway. My friend and I found this diner and went in. It was empty so we got seated right away. I ordered a medium well steak. It came out 9 minutes after.

"Called 4 times with a 30 minute period during business hours and each call went unanswered. I guess i am forced to eat elsewhere. Oh well. // The Sushi here is a joke and the service is horrendous (unless you are Jewish); we were obviously ignored because we were a male couple and not Jewish. The sushi tasted old and off, the whole time we were there we felt unwelcome and uncomfortable. Plus as another reviewer mentioned there is a club next door that plays really loud dance music and you can hear/feel the bass through the wall. I can not recommend this place to anyone. // I will never come here againWe waited a long time for a noodle soup, but it tastes toooooooo light which like noodle in the water.

"I have to start by saying that by me coming from the south (NC) and being well traveled I have very high expectations of barbecue that of been met by very few places in the north. This place doesn't meet it. I ordered pork barbecue sandwich. It got me full along with a sangria from Low Tide Bar one booth over but it lacked flavor (salt maybe) and was a little too dry for me. // Basically if you are used to good bbq do not eat at this place.

"The aggravation problem since this hookah bar has been opened. The excessive noises & LOUD talking every single night from mid night to early morning. It's so disturbing& unbearable to sleep for all the neighbors who shared the back courtyard together.

They brought us two chicken salad sandwiches and when I pointed out the error I was told curtly ""well that's what we have."" No offer was made to get me something else or to take the order back. I figured i should at least get it wrapped up so i coukd give it to a homeless person since they were going to charge me for their mistake.

"I had better Indian food than here's. It was reasonable for the price but the atmosphere killed my appetite. Hope they clean restroom and eating space often. Chai was good so two stars. Only for vegetarian. // I'm sorry but I don't understand what all the great reviews are about except for the price! We were excited to try it but we were really disappointed.

"Came home from work and ordered some Chinese from the place that stuck a menu on my porch. It claims to be Chinese and Pan Asian, but it seems like it's mostly Thai that makes up the ""Pan Asian."" Delivery came relatively quickly. I liked the steamed dumplings (came with quite a flavorful sauce), but the rest of the meal means I will not be ordering from them again. Chicken Chow Fun was gummy.

"I've ordered from here a few times. I didn't like the quesadillas but the chicken tacos are ok. Everything you add outside the meat and the taco, you have to pay extra. // Last time I came I didn't get charged extra for using my card. Poor communication between cook and cashier. I really hope the burgers are still good because breakfast sucks! // Didn't enjoy meal. Quesadillas were thick with scarce filling. My empanada was changed to all cheese bc they ran out of meat (but they never called to Advise) .

"This place is trash. The staff is rude & stingy. They serve food as if they're about to run out. Serving small potions of food that looks to be from the day before leftovers.

"Not sure why this place has such great reviews. I NEVER leave reviews, but my experience ordering from this place was really subpar. I ordered something directly off of their menu on seamless (ie., just clicked it...). It came within the delivery window, but didn't have all of the ingredients. I called, they wanted to send over the missing ingredients? I mean, make a new sandwich... I can assemble my own without tipping you. The correction arrived 40 minutes later and was STILL incorrect. When I called to address the problem, the person who answered the phone argued with me that he had ""put everything on"" the sandwich, including things that are not listed.

Avoid the hassle and go elsewhere! <|summary|> - Conduct an internal review of the restaurant's order accuracy and fulfillment processes, as there seem to be issues with delivering orders as requested.

"I ordered for delivery this evening. I ordered a gyro, falafel, and fries. The restaurant is 10 minutes away, but it took over an hour before my food arrived. I provided special instructions when I ordered online, which the delivery guy didn't seem to have read. Consequently everything I ordered was cold.

"Meh...I do like shiny things so it was a given that I stopped to grab something at this shiny silver truck thing. I ordered: The pork belly slider and slider (which I forget the name of). Both were dry, kinda tough and flavor didn't leave much of an impression. Not the way 'soul food' is supposed to be made. The octopus jambalya was good for the first few bites and then required a few cups of water to counter the SALT! The place came up from 1 star because they serve curly fries...but then again so does Carl's Jr/Hardees. 2 Star Shrug...I'll be back if its sunny and the silver truck shines at me again. <|summary|> - Improve the quality and texture of the pork belly slider and the unnamed slider, as they were found to be dry and tough.

"Never ordering from here again. 12pm, I phone ordered 2 orders of pancakes with bacon and eggs. An hour passed, then two. After my third or fourth phone call inquiring about the delivery boy, the employee over the phone tells me the delivery boy had ""made it to me and back, with the money"" How was this possible when he'd never reached me ? After the 2nd phone call, the man over the phone said my food would arrive in 2 minutes. After waiting for 15 minutes after my 2 minute promise, I called to cancel my order.

- Apologize to the affected customer and address their dissatisfaction to maintain goodwill and potentially prevent negative word-of-mouth."
"Yeah, I concur. This pop up concept is disappointing. We ordered pretty much everything available and unfortunately everything came out semi-cold which makes me think they do a big batch of cooking and then just serve as people come in. Thank god we ate a (pre) dinner at Porsena while waiting for space to open up at Lakh Lakh. // $7-$8 persian-inspired plates of ridiculous portions - you'd have to order 4 per person in order to feel remotely full! 3 tablespoons of persian lamb stew for $8 (without any rice)???

- The problem of space and waiting times might be indirect feedback, as the customer ate elsewhere while waiting for space to open up at your establishment. Consider improving the waitlist system or customer flow.

"Cashier Kerri had the personality of a rock. She didn't utter a word during the entire transaction....no 'hello'... no 'yo can swipe your card'...no 'thank you' or good night.

"I grew up going to Chateau. This was the place to run to on your high school lunch break and grab a mish. Well I can only guess my palette was not as refined in high school because I can't ever imagine why I ever thought this place was good.I recently stopped there to get a turkey mish to go for the beach. Hmmmm,....$9 for some chopped up iceberg lettuce, diced tomato, and the worst cold cut turkey I have ever had. What a pure disappointment. People from the 5 towns will swear by this place, and they are probably the only people that go there. With that it will stay in business, but if you ever pass by, DO NOT be tempted to stop in. The waitstaff and all that are in there are all terrible!! <|summary|> - Customer nostalgia for the restaurant during high school does not equate to a positive review in the present.

"I've only ever lurked on Yelp before, but I had to write in here. Taking classes at Columbia during the summer, this is the only close kosher option. I don't know what the food is like during the school year, but, at least during the summer, STAY AWAY from non-Israeli foods on this menu. The pizza is left out to sit for hours, the ""paninis"" are gelatinous goop, the ""mac and cheese"" is spaghetti with some tasteless sauce. The Israeli items are pretty decent. Don't go out of your way to go here. // Poor service, average quality, limited menu, not so clean. The only kosher place at Columbia, other than dining halls. <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews you provided, here are a few actionable insights for your restaurant:

Act promptly on these points to potentially improve customer satisfaction and draw a larger clientele during the academic year and summer sessions."
"I get the idea that Church Bar underwent a change recently. After reading all of the great reviews, I decided to check it out with some friends. They had hibiscus drinks on the menu which was interesting, but other than that, this place didn't have much. Very small selection of liquor, no food options (although we were allowed to have food delivered), and in desperate need of a renovation. It felt like more of a restaurant than a bar; it didn't seem like a place to get drunk. It was also super dead... and it made it a little awkward when the bartender came over and told my friend he couldn't rest his head on the table. <|summary|> Here are the actionable insights from the customer reviews:

I had to go back out to pick up the right order because they all of a sudden aren't delivering that night, Ridiculous. This place could actually do really well if they worked on this issue. After last night I went back to get the ""right order"" it still wasn't shredded beef, it was shredded pork An she kept insisting it was beef. Also the cachapa was gross soggy An lacked flavor.

- Consider implementing an order review system before orders go out to prevent errors."
"I ordered the chicken Greek salad based on a previous review. The chicken is hard and overcooked. The salad is soggy. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because they were quick. It was $7.50 - not super cheap - definitely on the cheaper side - but I guess you get what you pay for. // Grrr.....I miss Jimmy. This place isn't the same w/o him. The new guy standing in his spot seems like he could be a nice enough guy but he's not Jimmy. The feta on my Athena chicken wrap tastes sour...or maybe it's the tzatziki but something is off.

"Four of us (two couples) came here for dinner on a Saturday night, the main reason being that they served Bercelona style food. Unfortunately, nothing about their food, including patatas bravas, was Barcelona like. The food was merely average, service was OK and the atmosphere below average. Yet the prices were above market level. I expected better, especially given the average reviews. I won't be coming here again. // ""GLASS EN LA COMIDA"" The food was bad. The place is nice. We had a piece of glass in our food and walked out. There's no love in this cooking or their wine selection. Just upscaled prices for what looks like would be a promising place. Had these sentiments prior to finding the piece of glass but that really left us speechless. <|summary|> Based on the restaurant customer reviews provided, here are the main insights that could help improve the restaurant experience:

- **Reputation and Expectations**: There is a discrepancy between customer expectations, influenced by the restaurant's reputation or market positioning, and their actual experience. This needs to be addressed either by managing expectations better or improving the offering to align with those expectations.
- **Customer Retention**: At least one customer has explicitly expressed the intent not to return. It is crucial to investigate what factors specifically led to this decision and address them to improve retention.

Actions for consideration could include:

- Reviewing and updating the menu to ensure that the food is authentic and high-quality.
- Re-evaluating pricing strategy to reflect the quality and authenticity of the food and enhance perceived value.
- Enhancing staff training to improve service levels.

"Sorry to say that the steak sandwich we had last week 11/8 was nothing special ... a piece of meet on a day old roll with bacon and egg - I make it better at home.

- Maintaining the quality of popular items on the menu like the Sangria, which received positive feedback."
"I am just starting to leave reviews for all of the places I have visited. I'm a huge foodie and look up tons of reviews and always know what I am ordering before reaching the restaurant. Being new in Morristown, my husband and I decided to check out the known gem in Chatham this last November. I feel bad leaving a mediocre review because Aida was charming as can be but my tastebuds don't lie. The food was edible but nothing special. The yogurt dip was spoiled, the baba ghanoush was flavorless, the chicken shwarma was typical and the chicken special (with mushrooms and gravy) needed a lot of salt and spice.

"Very expensive per portion -very little meat and fish portions served with tons of rice & beans! I like their food to be fair but my husband and I have decided to stop going here even though it's very convenient to get to. We just got tired of almost having to beg for extra meat servings for the money they ask per plate. Like 1 small pork chop on top of a huge plate of rice. Never buy any meat in a sauce at this place!! You'll end up with mainly meat flavored sauce and no meat. Then if you ask for meat you can actually see they'll say ""you mean you want extra?"". If you like meat with your rice save your money and avoid this place! Very sad to see this change in meat portions-I do like the food... // Very unfriendly customer service .. White rice very mushy but stew chicken was okay. <|summary|> - Ensure that portion sizes, specifically meat and fish, match the value and price expectations of customers. Large plates of rice and beans seem to be overshadowing the main featured items.

"Like the food, hate the service!! Healthy food is limited in my neighbirhoid, so to find Blue Coco had smoothies and salads was just awesome. I've only had 3 salads which were average but i like how small they cut the vegetables. My main complaint is the service, the clerks make you feel rushed, they don't smile and they're not courteous.

I was craving some good Peruvian food and this by far was my worse experience for Peruvian food. // I decided to give the place a shot again and found a fucking roach in my food.

"I ordered delivery from here at 7:42 pm. It is now 9:44 and still no food. I called several times and was told food was on its way. I guess the delivery guy thought I lived on the moon or something and he's on the space shuttle with my food. They are the worse and food is sub-par. Do not waste your time ordering from here as you will wait and wait and wait and maybe never even receive your food.

"Overrated ramen joint in midtown east. Food: 1.5 Ambiance: 3 Value: 3 Service: 3 Overall: 2 Stopped by based on Yelp reviews and have never been so disappointed in fellow Yelpers. I ordered the white kakuni ramen and some takoyaki on the side. The ramen was over-salted and flavors were muddled. There was no depth of flavor that I was looking for, only saltiness. Also, the bowl was loaded with raw onions which I'm not used to and it overpowered all the other flavors. The takoyaki was ok but not great. The flavor was fine, but the middle was way too mushy to be good takoyaki. Overall, I was very disappointed. The ramen competition is fierce in the area so try one of the others. Totto is three blocks away. Otherwise, you'd probably get better ramen out of a package. <|summary|> - Improve the balance of seasoning, particularly reducing the salt level in your ramen, as customers find it too salty and overpowering.
- Consider revisiting the flavor profile of your ramen to add depth and prevent a muddled taste, as customers are looking for a rich and distinct flavor experience.

"I was excited to see there's a Le Baobab in Brooklyn as I'm a frequent customer at the Harlem location. I'm highly disappointed in the management and customer service, it just took them 2hrs to deliver my food, my kids were supposed to be in bed an hour ago and I'm literally 7 blocks away. When I first called it seemed like the lady didn't know how to take the order and literally took my number and told me she'll call me back. 15mns later I CALL BACK, placed the order fine. 30mns later received a call from the delivery guy, he said: "" I just got to the restaurant, I will eat then deliver your food, give me 10mns"", fine.

"I had eaten at this truck when it was called NYC Cravings, which was a strangely non-descriptive name. I found the meat to be bland, and the rice to be dry. They were also at the Vendys, and it struck me the same way. Very disappointing. But now that they've shed the Cravings tag and anointed themselves Bian Dang, I'd give them another shot. Add in the factor that they were doing a lunch special deal today, I headed over despite the rainy weather. Sold out. At a little after 1 PM. They reached a new level of disappointment. Here's a tip: If you want to rehabilitate your image through a special, you better put our mouths where your money is. <|summary|> - Improve food seasoning and moisture to avoid descriptions of ""meat to be bland"" and ""rice to be dry.""
- Consistency in quality should be maintained across different locations, such as the NYC Cravings truck and the Vendys, to prevent customer disappointment.
- Rebranding from NYC Cravings to Bian Dang can be confusing; ensure clear communication about the change to avoid the image of a ""strangely non-descriptive name.""
- Consider offering guaranteed availability or a reservation system for lunch specials as selling out by 1 PM causes customer dissatisfaction.
- The promotion of special events or deals can generate interest but be prepared for increased demand to avoid running out of food.
- Rebranding efforts, such as a name change, should coincide with improvements in food quality to successfully rehabilitate the restaurant's reputation."
"First time customer and will definitely be my last. I walked in the store and greeted the guy behind the counter and he looked at me and rolled his eyes. As I patiently waited for about 10 mins without him acknowledging me he states ""If your getting impatient then you need to leave!!"" I turned around to look to see who he was talking to and realized he was talking to me. Then I asked ""why do you feel like I'm being impatient?"" Then he states because Of the way I your looking at me"" then commence to carryon about how he's the only person working and he's not dealing with me and walks away. A+ service!!

"Usually get take out from this place very often. They raised their prices significantly over night. With the higher prices came more rice n less sushi in the rolls. // Small neighbourhood joint serving Chinese and sushi.

"Disappointing. The salad looked delicious in the photos. I ordered a fig and olive salad. It came in a small plastic tub with a tiny slab of chicken. The worst part were the figs were not even fresh. But dried figs. Very misleading for $10. // Mixed grill was awful. Everything was burnt to a crisp with very little seasoning. Rice was undercooked and tasteless. I have travelled all around Morocco and this is not authentic. Don't believe the positive reviews. Many are from fake users with only one review. // This place is NOT Moroccan! Do not even bother to try any Moroccan items on the menu. Bad Harira, tea, tagine, and service! <|summary|> Here are the actionable insights based on the customer reviews:

- Investigate the claims of fake positive reviews and take steps to ensure authenticity in future reviews. This could include encouraging honest feedback from all customers and monitoring review patterns.
- Reevaluate the customer service experience, as it was mentioned negatively, and make necessary improvements to ensure a more pleasing experience for the guests.

The food was cold when it got to me over an hour later when they said within half hour. I am 5 mins away. Disappointing. // HORRIBLE SERVICE! I ordered my food off Seamless at 9:10pm and called the restaurant at 10:10pm. They said the delivery guy was on the way, I called Seamless at 10:30pm and then the delivery guy called me asking if I was a completely different address!

"Where should i start? the parking lot is always gated off and way to large for the size of the cafe. the prices are absolutely OUTRAGEOUS for what you get. lunch should not cost 18 dollars unless you are enjoying some delicious cuisine in NYC. i paid over 3 dollars for a root beet and over 9 for a corn muffin and a coffee. the food is horrible, the burgers need to be eaten with a fork and knife due to the sloppy mess they serve people ( everything falls right off the bun). i just dont get it. the only reason they are in business is because parking is so tight in the lots that people in the building are forced to eat there. i will never go back and give them business again. it is the equivalent of paying for a luxury car and taking public transportation. <|summary|> Actionable insights derived from the customer reviews:

- Evaluate the pricing strategy, as customers find the prices to be very high, especially for what they are getting in return. Consider adjusting them to be more in line with customer expectations.

In all cases, direct communication with customers for more detailed feedback might be beneficial in pinpointing specific issues and developing targeted improvements."
"I definitely had better Halal Cart.. Also, why is it manhattan price?! Rice was dry, meat was meh, salad was measly, the person didn't even fill up the box all the way with rice or meat and it has a strong fragrance to its food. Felt like I was eating perfume. There isn't too many halal carts in that area, so maybe that's why they are so popular? Either way, I wasn't a big fan and probably won't be going back again. // it's no 53rd and 6th, but it'll do for flushing halal meat, the guy is pretty slow though, it's not fun when it's cold, standing there 15mins waiting in 20 degree weather while he chats up a storm with a random lady in front of you. recently got a new cart, but somehow takes longer to make food. <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews provided, here are some actionable insights for the restaurant:

"I wasn't thrilled. I bit into my arepa de choclo and tasted nothing but corn meal (It tasted a lot like pancake batter). I normally purchase this from another spot in Jackson Heights on the weekends, but since I was in the area I tried it here. Though the arepa wasn't very large I couldn't finish it (muy empalagosa). The coffee had too many unidentifiable particulates at the bottom of my mother's cup so I couldn't even drink mine. There are too many decent Colombian bakeries in the area; I won't be returning here. <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews provided, here are the actionable insights for the restaurant to consider:

"Family stopped in and had the thin pork belly and kalbi.....yeah ok, banchan was good and the pork belly was decent, but the kalbi they brought out, already cooked was so chewy my kids had to spit it out after chewing and chewing and chewing.... horrible never going back.

I'm used to marinated meats! <|summary|> - Consider improving the quality and tenderness of the kalbi, as it was too chewy and caused negative experiences for children.

When we went to return the disgusting food and get our money back they didn't apologize, were rude, told us we were wrong, and wouldn't give us a refund.

"I normally don't write any reviews on yelp, but this place is SO BAD that I feel obligated to warn others. They must be crazy if they think this is place is going to work. The prices are outrageous. $25 cheese plate had literally 4 slices of processed cheese cut into triangles, and on the side we got a couple of Ritz crackers fresh out of the box. The white wine we ordered came close to room temperature. One star because I don't have the option to give zero. Beware.

4. Consider reaching out to the reviewer to understand their concerns in more depth and offer to rectify the situation if possible."
"If you're looking for tasty, prompt chinese take-out/delivery in NYC, look elsewhere. After calling at only 6pm to place an order for delivery, the restaurant informed me that they were out of several menu items. Very disappointing. So I settled on a stir-fried beef and veggies combo dish with roast pork fried rice and an egg roll. The meat was tough, the rice was too glutinous, and the egg roll wasn't fully cooked so the inside was pretty much raw (wrapper and all). Not worth the time OR energy. // Noodle 36 is gone, along with most of the block. Rumor has it that it's all going to turn into a T-Mobile. <|summary|> - Review the menu to ensure all items are in stock and update it frequently to avoid informing customers late that certain dishes are unavailable.

"The pizza is brutally average at best. Had a plain and spinach mushroom slice. Very low taste. I covered both with garlic power and added a little salt to the veggie slice. The veggies aren't fresh. Canned 'shrooms and frozen spinach. I'm the ONLY person in the joint at 2pm. #weird // Don't order the mixed salad! $7.00 and it's slightly bigger than a side version. It cost me $9.25 because I added mozzarella cheese to it. This place has some set!!! The only reason they didn't get one star is the dressing is the best.I used to frequent the original on E.29th St. but I'll never step foot in place ever again! <|summary|> - The pizza quality is considered average at best; consider improving the recipe or ingredients.

"Great looking sports bar but it needs to work on service. We had to walk out after waiting 25 minutes for our food. Manager said they had computer problems.

"Decent food. Prices across menu are inconsistent: some things seem very expensive, some way too expensive and no menu seems to list their offerings. The staff serves customers in random order.

"I am VERY picky about pizza so take this with a grain of salt But I'm not a fan. The tomato sauce was bland and minimal and it was too cheesy and dripped oil. It also folded over and wouldn't keep it's shape. All this said, it's not the worse pizza and the guy behind the counter is nice but I havent yet found a good pizza spot in cypress hills // overly priced for crappy food. the cheese is nasty and the slices are literally dripping with oil like really drippy. once upon a time the only thing i used to look forward every winter for they're zepollies. they used to be 5 for a dollar now they are 5 for $2 <|summary|> - Improve the tomato sauce flavor as it was described as bland and minimal.

"Don't ever eat here! Found a roach in my salad and owner tried to say I put I there when I asked for refund and a new salad. // Good pizza, lasagna is weak with the meat, i must have caught them on a bad day. // I went in twice and both times the pizza was soggy.

"Ordered a chicken club panini from meal pass today. I arrive with the mealpass sign on the counter but they have no idea what the meal of the day is or what food should be ready for me. They then make me wait in line with everyone else and order my food from the sandwich counter- which completely defeats the purpose of mealpass. When I ask for the chicken club they advise that they don't have any left. As a part of this program, the restaurant is informed of how many people will be comping to pick up a lunch that day at 9:30am- there is no reason they shouldnt have a sandwich or be able to make me one.

"I waited an hour to get the worse large pizza in the world. The pizza was running warm to cold. The pizza was doughy, not enough cheese. It was just a fail and a bad experience TRYING to eat it. I ate one slice and gave up. My friend threw her slice out the window so the birds could eat it. I should have learned from last time. // Original owners were the best. Pizza was delicious.

"Overall, the banquet sitdown dinner was good and the service was satisfactory. BUT. The owner is clueless. She promised to close the restaurant for us (on a Wednesday afternoon, when the restaurant is supposedly closed anyway) and then went back on her word and said she can't turn people away if they show up. Umm, why the heck not? We had a large group of elderly guests - over 90 years old. On the way out, they were walking out very slowly. Because they're ELDERLY and had walkers.......... The owner is standing at the back of the restaurant screaming ""Close the door, I have the AC going!!""

"The shop owner was super friendly and really nice. We started with some fresh fruit juices which were great. I asked what the best dish was and he recommended the Bife a Caballo. It was eggs on fried onions on steak. The steak was rough and dry and the eggs were plasticky. My friends were unimpressed with their dishes, too. It might be better if you try the pastry, but for sit downs meal it wasn't very good. // Our waiter Diego was very inattentive. We arrived before two other parties. It has been over 20 minutes and all of the other tables have received their orders. But we are still sitting her without our food. I am appalled by the service here. I'm giving an extra star because the food was good. <|summary|> - The shop owner is very friendly and nice.
- The fresh fruit juices offered are great and well-received by customers.
- A dish recommended by the owner, Bife a Caballo (steak with eggs on fried onions), might need improvement as the feedback indicates the steak was rough and dry, and the eggs were plasticky.
- Friends of the reviewer were unimpressed with their dishes, suggesting potential issues with food quality that might extend beyond a single menu item.
- The pastries might be worth trying according to the suggestion that it might be better than the sit-down meals.

"The reason I am giving the restaurant 1 star is because when the owner was warming up our rice he took it out of the microwave to check it and he checked with his fingers sticking his hands through the rice, and even though I told him stop it and I was asking my husband in front of him to tell him to stop, he still continued, then continued reheating it and then apologize afterwards.

"Let's start with the good points. It's a nice addition to Fort Lee, pretty inside and I'm a big fan of Middle Eastern food so I was intrigued. We started with lentil soup which was very good. Tried an assortment of apps, none really stood out (hummus, tahini). Salads and chicken skewers were ok but didnt pop. Service was good. Four of us had general same reaction. It's fairly new so hopefully they will work the kinks out. <|summary|> - Ensure the Middle Eastern menu, particularly the lentil soup, is highlighted as it received a positive remark and contributed to attracting the customer to the restaurant.
- Consider reviewing and possibly enhancing the appetizer selection (hummus, tahini) as they failed to impress.
- Evaluate the salads and chicken skewers offerings; although they were adequate, they did not stand out. Look for ways to improve these options to create signature dishes.

"This particular location is better than a regular dollar store, however after experiencing the one in Westchester there is no way you can compare. // The store itself is poorly laid-out, and they get ridiculously full, so it felt like Black Friday all over again in here. Lot of selection, of exceptionally sub-par merchandise. Sorry - next. <|summary|> - This location outperforms an average dollar store.

"The chicken over rice tastes is more like pulled chicken slathered with bbq sauce rather than grilled spiced chicken. Not what I was expecting.

Their rice had some sort of sweet spice on it (possibly cinnamon?) which I did not particularly care for. <|summary|> - Address the chicken over rice dish presentation as it is perceived to be more like pulled chicken drenched in BBQ sauce, contrary to customer expectations of grilled spiced chicken.
- Consider modifying the chicken preparation or description in the menu to align with customers' expectations.

- Assess the inclusion of sweet spices like cinnamon in the rice to ensure it appeals to the target audience, since not all customers favor it."
"I really wanted to like this place. It's close to my apartment and has an unpretentious vibe. I came by in the afternoon and ordered A decaf Americano. I was charged $3.25 which is a lot for just espresso and water. At that price it should be excellent but instead the drink I got tasted like warm water with some coffee spilled in it. I assume the regular espresso is better and I will give them one more try but so far I'm not impressed. <|summary|> - Review the pricing of the decaf Americano to ensure it's competitive and provides value.

"Well, I am fully disgusted enough to write a review, this place needs to have the health department pay them a visit and shut them down. (I called and reported them myself today) This is the 3rd time I have come in here and there has been a dog in there, but today was the most disgusting, the dog was lifted over the sneeze guard and the cook was petting him allowing the food underneath to be covered in doghair!

"A group of 50 or so of us went to the lounge and we were treated like we were down south in segregated land. This is truly the era of Trump. Even in liberal NYC. The bar ""manager"" insisted that she didn't want us there, didn't want to play hip hop music, accused us of smoking marijuana inside the lounge while we were all dressed in our fancy cocktail attire. She was just downright rude and disrespectful. She was mad we were there in an already empty establishment. Our group is not a rowdy bunch. Everyone is in their 30s and 40s, all professionals.

"Little hole-in-the wall pizzeria that also serves some sandwiches and hot Italian food. Rickety benches in the back and standing-room wall countertops, too, if you want to eat at those. Soccer on TV. Heroes you order upfront, in the middle is pizza. They have a $5 for two cheese slices and a small drink (16 oz.?). Simple but in a land of great pizza, this falls somewhere in-between. My pieces, I noticed, were also smaller than the next guy's... cheese wasn't melty at all and very little in the way of tomato sauce. They did have plenty of peppers and dried parm to throw on the top, though.

The food came out one plate at a time-- the 2nd omelette wasn't started before the first was finished. Food was mediocre and did not meet the description on the menu (no side of fresh fruit).

"This sushi was horrible. I spent $70 and I am throwing more than half of the sushi in the garbage. My boyfriend was making gagging sounds as he was eating it. I don't know how this place has good reviews. Maybe people just haven't had really good sushi. This sushi was very fishy, small rolls. Even the Mango was of poor quality. Never again! // The price is alright, especially with the combo, but the sashimi is not so fresh, I had some stomach problems shortly after. I will not eat sushi from here again, but I might try the cooked dishes <|summary|> - Improve sushi quality, as customers are finding it unsatisfactory and inedible, causing them to dispose of more than half of it.

"Oil change! WD -40 ! Unfortunately thats what I felt like I was encountering when I ate here. I had calderetta which was soaked with oil, fortunately not to the point of seeing my reflection.

"Although I absolutely love African cuisine this place is THE worst in terms of customer service. The food is good but they fail horribly in the hospitality area. My advise is to treat EVERY customer with respect and be open to constructive criticism. If I point out that a price needed to be updated on YOUR menu to reflect what your charging me, FIX IT! Instead the owner acts like she has a chip on her shoulder from me voicing my opinion. I can easily spend my money elsewhere.

Unbelievable! <|summary|> - Improve customer service, as it's considered the worst despite the love for African cuisine.

"I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the woman who helped us was very nice. Unfortunately, the food wasn't. This place is OVER PRICED. We got a tiny and stale spinach wrap with just chicken salad inside of it and a small sandwich with the same basic chicken salad in it (nothing else) and a very small container of ""kale salad"" that had 20% kale and the rest was cabbage. This salad was okay in taste... however it was clear that the veggies weren't properly cleaned (served with old or dirty cabbage). For this and two drinks we paid a little over $40.00. Very disappointing lunch here. Saw other reviews and assumed it would be good but this wasn't the case... <|summary|> - Improve food quality; customers found the food unsatisfactory and not fresh.

"If u don't know how to do BBQ, don't go. It's self service, nobody help u.

"Order half a roast chicken with rice and beans and oxtail with rice and beans. Chicken and beans were salty. Oxtail was salty too but was tender. Food was expensive for neighborhood ""hole in the wall"". $7 for quarter chicken and $10 for half.

"DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a review of the Dominican food, which seems to be what everyone seems to love about this place. I saw that they have a breakfast special menu and saw that a BLT was only $2. WHAT?!!! That must be too good to be true!! So I ordered one. Before unwrapping it, I was so excited because it seemed pretty big. However, once I opened it, I knew that it was indeed too good to be true. What I got was really a lettuce sandwich with one slice of tomato and bacon. So it was a BLLLLLLLLLLLLLLT sandwich. :( Not pleased at all, and I'm not even going to try anything else from the breakfast special. <|summary|> - Review mentions a poor experience with the breakfast special, specifically referencing a BLT sandwich that did not meet expectations.

"Sliders: decent, I had the bacon jam slider, interesting although i couldn't actually taste the bacon, only see it. Hot dogs: Someone answer me one question: Why on earth does sweet chili exist? End review right there, Chili, especially hot dog chili should have at least a mild spice. // Came here hopeful as I absolutely love hotdogs. Was totally disappointed. I was expecting a nice big bun. They literally use the mushy small wonderbread hotdog buns that you buy in packs at the grocery store. I would think that a place specializing in hotdogs would use a better bun. No reason to go back. <|summary|> Based on the reviews provided, here are some actionable insights:

- Improve bacon visibility/flavor in the bacon jam sliders since customers can't taste the bacon, only see it.
- Review the chili recipe, particularly the hot dog chili; consider adding more spices to ensure it meets expectations for a ""sweet chili"" experience.

"the food was aweful and the service attentive. The wine list was awful. Not much I can say more but please do not bother as there are so many other places that are nearby and so much better. // I was there yesterday for lunch. It is old, tired with a filthy bathroom and upstairs. I complained but I think that no one cared....when walking up the dirty stairs to the bathroom, which is really a store room area I was appalled.

"A real disappointment... A Luke warm(at best) churro with no cinnamon and a rude woman behind the counter. // I love churros but I was disappointed by the very overpriced Dulcinea churros. They charge you $7.75 for 3 small churros that had almost no filling inside.

Absolutely disgusting. // Okay so, my BF asked that I post this review because he's upset. This is the second time now that he's called ahead to order something for pick up, and then when he gets there, all he gets is a bunch of confusion between the workers and always leaves with NO FOOD. These guys need to get it together. Aside from that, he likes the food, and I think it's pretty bland honestly. I've had soup, salad, and some kind of roast chicken meal there, and I thought all 3 were very boring and extremely bland.

First of all, the taste and second of all, quantity. Basically, there was nothing to eat except pickles and salted tomatoes. The fish was not eatable at all as well as meat.

"Quite simply, do not go if Dotty is working. She is an angry woman who obviously does not want to be there and takes it out on whomever happens to be around. The food is what it is... 2 am the only place in town open... which is good enough for me. But I will not be going back as long as Dotty is working there. Nothing worse than an abrasive, abusive staff to ruin any good night out. If you want to feel welcome in Highlands, do not go to Katz. <|summary|> - Address the behavior of an employee named Dotty who is reportedly angry and takes her frustration out on customers.
- Assess the situation to determine how Dotty's behavior is affecting the customer service experience.

"I'd give the food and the prices 3 stars, however I am giving it 2 stars because every time I come Barb looks so miserable. Every time I have visited, I am the only one there.

"I went to a wedding where Esprit was the caterer and I was not impressed. Everyone was starving during the cocktail hour because there was not enough food or servers. Also, there weren't enough bartenders and everyone was waiting around for a drink. And then they ran out of white wine, champagne, and patron---ALL the makings of a good party. The bartenders also put out tip jars! So not ok. When you went to the buffet stations, there was no one to serve you. Serving trays would be sitting there empty and no one replaced them.

"Awful! I don't like anything about this place besides the paint job. Heading into Famous Gyro World, you would think that they are experts at making gyros. The pita was burnt and the ""lamb"" slabs were barely heated through so there was none of that tasty browned meat action. This atrocity was unforntunately topped off with bitter onions, soggy tomatoes, and oxidizing lettuce. More tzaziki sauce, PLEASE! I know I'm not supposed to hold high standards when ordering something that comes off a giant skewer, but anyone who has eaten enough gyro meat can tell that there are slight differences in the actual meat content and quality. This was like eating a giant can of warm, lamb-flavored Spam. <|summary|> - Address food quality issues: Ensure that pitas are not burnt and protein options like lamb are properly heated and have the desired browning.

"Before writing my review I read the other reviews and looked at the photos. What we got looked nothing like what's in the photos! Maybe we were there on an off day. Ordered a spinach, feta and vegetable salad. Got mesculun mix with misc cheeses on it. Came home and made myself some lunch. Friend ordered smoked turkey crepe - it looked like a boiled dumpling sitting all alone on a white plate.

"Pretty average pizza, besides the sesame seeds on the crust. Nothing to rave about. Would I go back.. No // I feel bad posting this because there are so many positive reviews, but I thought my two plain slices were mediocre.

"$10 minimum on credit cards and they're super rude about it. This was my favorite place and they just added this rule. I hate when businesses turn customers away instead of building credit card fees into their price structure. Hey bamboo! Give a cash discount rather than penalizing people who don't carry cash. // I'm so confused about this place. I expect for the staff in any place that is supposed to be healthy to know what they are serving people. I couldn't get a straight answer out of one of the girls on what exactly were the additives in the smoothie (that I was charged practically $10 for). Every time I eat a salad I end up feeling weird. Go to the little coffee shop next door. <|summary|> - Review the establishment's policy on credit card minimums and examine the way customers are informed about it and how staff is trained to handle the situation; customers find the enforcement of this rule to be rude and it may be driving loyal customers away.

"Order lunch here last week at 10:30. Food didn't show up until 12:45. My lunch time at work was over at 12:15, and they promised multiple times it would be there by 12. Food is great but don't order if you are in any kind of rush. And don't call to complain because they get nasty. // I used to love this place. Unfortunately, they don't listen to what you want on your sandwiches. I got annoyed the first few times that they forgot the cheese but now they're forgetting cheese and adding tomatoes and lettuce. I'm highly allergic to tomatoes so I can't even pick them off the bread. I will no longer be shopping here since messing orders up is becoming habit. <|summary|> - Improve the speed and accuracy of food delivery, especially during lunch hours.

"NEVER come here when there is a live band.Bartender will shush and shame you. Fist bar I ever went to where conversations are not allowed. // Extremely rude and racist bartender. After I accidentally spilled my drink (mistakes happen), he refused to served me another one and told my friend mockingly""enjoy it, it's free!"" while pointing to me.

"Stupid place. Been open two weeks. And it's mis managed and they already are out of ingredients. Just went there for classic taro bubble tea and they turned me away. This place will NOT last long. They have one job to do and they couldn't do it. Tell your friends don't go there! // This place is highly rated because it's the only thing around. The coffee is terrible. Unless you want a sweet bubble / lychee / frappe / infused the unsweetened options are limited to bitter iced black tea or bitter iced Jasmine tea. Gross. Also because it's so small it's noisy. It's hot because the AC is weak / not working. You feel like a fly dying in the window. The music is great and staff is nice but slow. Like I said come here for slushies | bubble tea and skip the coffee. <|summary|> - Improve inventory management to avoid running out of ingredients.
- Assess and address issues with management practices as the restaurant is perceived as mismanaged.
- Consider expanding the range of unsweetened beverage options as current offerings are limited and not satisfactory.

"My onions were raw... and the rice was dry and hard. Overall was ok though. Halal guys has better white sauce. // Not sure why people refer to these carts as halal. I mean they are halal but that merely means the muslim equivalent as saying kosher. Anyways, like a lot of these other carts that get a cult following, I think this is 90% rep and 10% substance. Very average fare which can be had elsewhere. Not worth the extra $$$. // Lamb gyro had very tender and flavorful meat, but was a drippy, greasy mess. The white sauce has a strong dill flavor which I was not expecting but wound up enjoying, tempered by the decent heat in their hot sauce. Also enjoyed the sauteed onions they add instead of raw, but still the grease was off putting enough that I will most likely not be back. <|summary|> - Ensure that onions are thoroughly cooked, as customers have received raw onions.

- Consider how to differentiate the restaurant's reputation beyond just reputation ('90% rep and 10% substance') and emphasize quality.
- Reassess the pricing strategy, as the perceived extra cost does not seem justified by customer experience.
- Monitor the consistency and quality of the meat's preparation, as there was positive feedback about the tenderness and flavor of the lamb gyro despite the grease issue."
"Walked in to check out the market and possibly purchase some items however the set up is not organized. It was a little overwhelming since there was a mix of everything all over the place from prepared foods, un prepared (not cooked), soups and condiments. If they organize the market better I am sure it will do much better. It seems to currently serve a small niche within the Korean community and when I walked in I was the only shopper there at the time. They can easily expand their customer base by simply getting the market organized. <|summary|> - Improve organization of the market layout to prevent it from being overwhelming and to help customers navigate the area more easily.

"Fuck these folks. They are terrible. Though they have seemed to upgrade the facilities. At least they NOW tell you that their ham is ""turkey ham"" -- before they did not.

"Not sure how this place has so many good reviews..... I went todwy to get a sandwich (media noche) & I get half if a regular sandwich size, super greasy, cold meat & old bread. The old man that served me the sandwich didn't even wear gloves to make the sandwich after touching the register & handling money.

"Possibly the worst service I have experienced. I ordered $50 worth of delivery last night which took over 2 hours to arrive. I called over 7 times and was told it was coming until finally spoke to the manager who said there was a mistake! No compensation or apology was provided and food arrived cold! If you can't manage a delivery service, don't open it up to delivery! // Horrible quality in sushi. Not only that, but the first time I went, they got my order wrong. I shrugged it off and went back a second time. The second time I went they got my order wrong twice, charging me for a different, overpriced roll two times. Never coming back.

"I waited in line to place my lunch order at this food truck outside of my office today with much anticipation. My colleague got the veggie burger and I the beef platter with couscous. Both dishes were utterly. totally. inedible and had to be thrown away after a bite. My beef had dirt in it, but even if it hadn't...the food was stone cold and tasted terrible. This was one of the top 5 worst food moments of my life. It was right up there with the grim mystery-meat lunch in East Berlin at the tender age of 16 when The Wall was still up.

I ordered from this restaurant through Eat 24 and it has been 2 hours and my food is still not here yet. I'm highly upset not to mention hungry. I contacted Eat24 and the restaurant assured me that it would be here in the next 10-15 minutes.... 30-45 minutes ago.

"I was craving ramen and stopped in here since I was hungry and in the neighborhood. I ordered the beef miso ramen. I enjoyed the bamboo and pickles in the ramen, but there was no runny egg in my bowl as often is the case at other ramen restaurants. The broth wasn't especially rich, but there was a lot of beef in there (though not the most tender cuts one can get). At this price point, I would rather go to one of my favorite ramen spots in the East Village. <|summary|> Based on the customer's review:

"I ordered from this place last night, after one bite of the chicken and one bite of the beef, the meal was trashed. the quality of meat was one of the worst!! I ordered grilled chicken/beef combo. don't waste you money!! you will end up cooking something or ordering elsewhere. // Pretty much just like any Chinese owned and operated ""Mexican"" joint.

"Very disapointed! Overpriced bad food, empty place, very hot. They should stick to Ecuatorian food, although the Ecuatorian Ceviche was tasteless and soupy. Won't be going back, no wonder was empty. // My 2nd visit to Bistro 118. Unlike my very good steak au poivre a few months back my girlfriend ordered it this time and it was very weak. The steak was cut very thin and it was small. It looked like a small thin-cut pork chop. Everyone gets a bad steak once in awhile but this looked like it was bought cheap to save money. I like the place but the girlfriend was pissed. I haven't written the place off but I don't think we'll be coming back soon. <|summary|> - Consider re-evaluating prices to ensure they match the perceived value and quality of the food.

"Based on the other reviews you'd think they make the best breakfast sandwiches ever. I had a bacon, egg and cheese and it was a little below average in my opinion. The egg was a little overcooked and there definitely could've been more bacon. I just moved up here and haven't tried a lot of spots, but if this is getting 5 star reviews i'm a little worried. // Nicknamed the ""Smelly Deli"" while in high school around the corner, I, along with many others, consumed many many orders of philly steak, sides of fries, bacon egg & cheese, and a few others throughout the years.

"order any shrimp dish and they cant make it because its ""frozen"" like really? No accommodation whatsoever. Plus the girl that takes orders doesn't have any enthusiasm of being there.

"Terrible. I feel like I just left the Twilight Zone this place is so dated, and not in the good way. The diner was dark and a little smelly, which is reasonable since it hasn't been updated since the 40s. The food was bland at best, and I had to spit out the home fries. Even the coffee was undrinkable. We both came home with stomach aches. I have no idea how this place is still around, especially with the new ""young professional"" crowd moving in. // Came in based on good reviews here. Food was ok but the place is cluttered, messy, uncomfortably cramped and the service was useless. Got everything wrong, couldn't understand a word of what we said.

"I can't approve of this place. I didn't get sick is the only good thing I have to say. I'm not trying to Yelp this place out of biz, but the sushi was horrible. My advice to them is if they want to stay open, stick to the easy japanese comfort foods like curry, ramen, tempura and katsu. They're not going to have any repeat customers with the sushi. // I ordered a two roll combo with brown rice. The brown rice in my sushi was too dry, and THERE WERE BONES IN MY FISH.

"Tried the brisket sandwich at Smorgasburg in South St Seaport. You can choose lean, moist or mixed. I opted for the moist one, but it was the driest brisket I ever had.

"The ambiance is cafeteria-like. Very bright and lifeless. You walk in with the expectation of waitress service and instead your asked to order at the counter. It's not a bar and at the same time, not much of a restaurant. The food was subpar, lacked flavor, and was very salty. The garlic portobello that came in the burrito was pure garlic salt and almost inedible. There are so many better options for Mexican in this neighborhood. We will not be returning. // Good cemitas, my only question is why pay $9-10 for a fancy cemita when there's a plethora of bangin' home grown cemita and torta options in Sunny/Wood for $6-7? <|summary|> Here are the actionable insights distilled from the given customer reviews:

"What a horrible experience I had at this place. I ordered a simple turkey sandwich with lettuce and what I got was absolute disrespect. Upon opening my heavily wrapped sandwich I was greeted with a few slices of turkey drowned in mayo. After asking where my lettuce was they decided to tell me that I needed to pay $1.50 extra for them to add my lettuce that THEY forgot. Was not offered my money back and left furious.

I am a Dobbs Ferry resident and I won't return. // I was really disappointed in this place. Like other reviewers I waited about 35 minutes for a so-so panini that was very greasy. Smoothie was ready quickly but place is not well managed. Order wasn't communicated to the person making the sandwich until about 20 minutes when there was an a-ha moment and they realized.

The service was good, but what does that matter if the food is not high quality? Maybe it is my fault for ordering uncooked vegetables at a new-to-me place in the middle of winter, but I expected better at these prices in the middle of Bloomie's at one of the most famous malls in the country. So, uh, maybe avoid the salad here. <|summary|> - Investigate potential issues with the salad ingredients or preparation, as a customer reported getting sick shortly after eating a salad.
- Confirm the quality and safety of uncooked vegetables used in salads, especially during the winter season, as suggested by the customer's mention of raw vegetables and seasonal concerns.

"Close to GCT on park ave, it def caters to a business crowd. Stumbled upon this place while walking back to our hotel and thought we'd give it a try. There were mostly only bar seats available and so ended up sitting there, weird arrangement of sorts and slightly difficult to watch the tv if you're interested in a game. Got the steak tartare, which didn't remotely taste anything like it and felt there was too much aioli that took away the taste of the steak. Drinks are pretty overpriced too, guess its prob coz of the location and the crowd. It's probably better to come here for brunch and they have half off on their wine bottles which is a great deal. Not sure if I'd come here otherwise on a weekend night as such. <|summary|> - The restaurant's close proximity to Grand Central Terminal makes it attractive to a business crowd.

- The reviewer is uncertain about the appeal of the restaurant during weekend nights, suggesting that the atmosphere or offerings might need to be more enticing for the weekend crowd."

On top of the pizza tasting like cardboard and the soft dough overtaking everything, it was 18 dollar minimum meaning I spent way too much for this garbage.

Huge pieces of tofu which I did not like and the chicken tasted chewy. The vegetable fried rice looked kinda red-ish when I opened it, so I had a feeling it would be a little spicy, which is not what I wanted or expected from fried rice.

I never in my life would think a place would serve an insect in my food!! Gross. Needs to be health inspected. Service was really slow too. The old lady at the counter took forever to deliver my order.

"I came here cuz I needed a quick bite to eat before the Brooklyn Museum. Let me start by saying that I am a meat eater and this is a vegetarian restaurant. The smoothie I had was pretty good (some type of berry blend), but it was not that big for $5.50. The patties I had were both disappointing. I had the fake chicken one and the vegetable one. Both were really underwheleming. I wanted to try the soy, but they were out. I agree with other reviewers that the bread on the patties was good, but I really did not like the filling. <|summary|> - Consider adjusting portion sizes or pricing to align with customer expectations; a smoothie was deemed too small for its price ($5.50).
- Evaluate the quality and preparation of the patties offered, as the fake chicken and vegetable patties were both found to be unsatisfactory.
- Address the issue of stock running out, as the customer was unable to try the soy option due to it being sold out.
- Maintain the quality of the bread served with the patties, as it was highlighted positively by both the customer and other reviewers.
- Review the fillings used in the patties to improve taste and overall satisfaction as the current fillings did not meet the customer's approval."
"The staff was really really nice so I feel bad giving them a mediocre review. I love some Malaysian food so I was excited to go to Gold RIver when I saw it across the street. It just didn't taste as good as the other Malaysian places I have been to to try the same exact dishes. We had the -Kari Ayam which is like chicken curry. It was served room temperature. It was not hot enough. -House Special Pork with Yam which is pork belly with taro. It was served not hot enough. The fat on the pork belly was still white. -Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo which is various stuffed items like stuffed tofu, eggplant and peppers in a rich coconut curry soup. I just thought it lacked coconut, I didn't taste it at all, and the flavor was off. Worst curry soup I ever had. <|summary|> - Staff members were very pleasant.
- The Malay food was not up to expectations based on previous experiences at other Malaysian restaurants.
- The Kari Ayam (chicken curry) was served at room temperature and was not hot enough.
- The House Special Pork with Yam was also not served hot enough; the fat on the pork belly was undercooked (still white).
- The Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo (various stuffed items in a coconut curry soup) was lacking in coconut flavor, which was disappointing and made the soup taste off. It was the worst curry soup experienced by the customer.

Actionable steps for the restaurant:
- Ensure that hot dishes are served at the appropriate hot temperatures.
- Review cooking procedures for dishes like pork belly to ensure they are fully cooked before serving.
- Assess the recipe and preparation method for Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo to improve the coconut flavor and overall taste.
- Consider offering an apology and possibly a discount or complimentary dish to the customer to compensate for their unsatisfactory experience.
- Maintain the high level of service provided by the staff as it was appreciated by the customer."
"$34 bucks for a burger and fries. Let that sink in. $34 dollars for a burger and fries. The meat isn't imported from Japan. The bacon isn't from a pig that was once a family pet. All that doesn't matter though because they have used run of the mill ingredients, I believe the meat is cysco black label? And put it together to create the most basic and yet absurdly expensive burger in the city. Is it good? Yes. Is it $34 good? No. What really peeves me is that can get the same exact burger and fries in Chicago for around $10 bucks at Small Cheval. This markup is just absurd. <|summary|> - The price of the burger and fries combo ($34) is perceived to be too high.
- Customers note that the ingredients used are not exclusive or high-end (meat is not imported from Japan, bacon does not come from a pet pig, and ingredients are run-of-the-mill).
- It's mentioned that possibly lower grade meat (cysco black label?) is being used.
- Although the taste of the burger is good, customers question its value for money.
- There is a comparable burger and fries option available in Chicago at Small Cheval for around $10, suggesting that the price at the restaurant is not competitive.
- The markup on the burger and fries is viewed as excessive by customers."
"If I could I'd give this place no stars. This food is so greasy and the lady in the front desk has the nastiest attitude. Never again. // I went there before with a friend. The place is very tiny like a closet. No room to sit. The food was good. I called this morning for a delivery to my Job which was a block away. I was told the minimum for delivery was ten dollars. That's too much when it's a express little hole in the wall spot making breakfast I could make then we have to tip...nope. The sign on the place advertises Free Delivery.

"Came here for a quick lunch. I got the Liang Pi (cold skin noodles) $5 and the Chinese pancake $4. The noodles were ok but don't compare to Xians famous foods. The Chinese pancake was not good. First off it was difficult to eat - I wasn't sure if I should eat it like a sandwich or carve it up with knife and fork. It falls apart. In addition, it wasn't very flavorful and the iceberg lettuce and fried noodles didn't enhance anything. Definitely a pass on the Chinese pancake - although it was entertaining watching them make it. On the positive side, the lady at the counter is nice and willing to take orders in English. There are definitely other choices at this food court. <|summary|> - Evaluate the quality and taste of the Liang Pi (cold skin noodles) and possibly compare with that of local competitors (e.g., Xian's famous foods) to ensure they meet customer expectations.

"Do not get a salad there. They have no concept of what grilled chicken ceaser salad is. Very disappointed. I have iceberg lettuce a ton of onions and no parmigiano. Very disappointed in this. This is not a grilled chicken ceaser salad. // Bread was fresh and soft, had the italian sub...was OK overall but skimpy with the toppings. Saltiest italian sub i've ever had, perhaps due to it being 90% really salty ham and not the other meats that come with italian subs. <|summary|> - Improve the salad offering, particularly the grilled chicken Caesar salad; customers are disappointed with the presentation and ingredients, such as an abundance of iceberg lettuce and onions, and a lack of parmesan cheese.

"ARGH. Now I have to ask myself: ""was the shitty pizza I had yesterday a fluke? or was the pretty good pizza I had here before a fluke?"" I mean, as I was eating a slice, the crust just fell off in my hand. Pretty sure that's never happened before. Isn't that kind of Pizza 101: be sure the slice doesn't fall apart midway through eating it? And CANNED mushrooms? Come on, man. Don't play me like this, Pizza Chef. At this point, I'm just about ready to give up on Bed-Stuy's pizza places. // The pizza here is delicious, ESPECIALLY their Sicilian. It's hard to find a good Sicilian in the area as many of the new pizza places popping up don't offer it. But an hour and a half wait for ONE Sicilian pizza? Fix your oven and train your staff.

"Do NOT order from here...If I could give zero stars I would. Sent a pick up order on Seamless. When I went to pick up my order, the restaurant not only was not open, but did not appear to be a functional restaurant (i.e. furniture and tools strewn everywhere on the floor). I called the number on the Seamless account but it said the number was not set up. This is absolutely unacceptable and I would urge all prospective patrons to steer clear. // Their israeli salad was so bad! It was so sour that I had to take it out before eating my pita!

"Ate here today (Friday) and arrived around 12:30pm. Would have been nice to know before we ordered that we would be waiting 50 minutes for our food. I understand that there was a large order prior to ours and that we would be waiting a little while but we could have eaten an entire meal in the time it took for our food to be ready. There was only one cook and one person taking orders. We would have been a little more understanding had the person taking orders done more to acknowledge our long wait, apologize, and maybe offer us a drink. The food we received (2 chicken wraps, a shredded beef arepa, and fries) was good but nothing spectacular and definitely not worth the 50 minute wait. They need more people working during the lunch hour to handle the demand. <|summary|> - Consider informing customers about expected wait times before they order, especially during peak hours.

(Red Flag #1) Ordered hummus appetizer then spinach pie as my main dish and gyro plus side of fries as his. Came out of the kitchen as each thing was ready: free sides when you arrive (pickles, beets, olives and pita), then hummus and spinach pie together, then fries, then gyro.

Tables were dirty, waitress was grumpy, did not acknowledge us for the first ten minutes, food was greasy, I had to get up and ask for a fork and a napkin.

"The parking lot for a Saturday night seemed a little empty...but my groupon expired that day so we went in. There's a lady at the desk in the hall, we thought she was going to seat us? No, apparently we should just proceed inside she said. The bar was large, and the decor for the entire restaurant was beautiful. But alas, the service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter came over hurriedly after 10 mins and asked ""did you order yet?"" We said no. ""Okay what do you want?"" We ordered and he did not return to check on us until our food was wrapped by another server and we were ready to go.

I was excited to try this place and was very disappointed. // I was shocked when I received my chicken entre, the portion was so small, I thought I was at a Weight Watchers restaurant! // Went to this restaurant to try their Rosh Hashanah menu. While they did offer many small courses, the food was not good. The soup had no flavor, the main courses were okay but the desserts were inedible. The choices were bread pudding or baked apple.

"I ordered from here the week it opened and it was great, then my family started getting sushi and said it was very low quality so they tried again but it wasn't any better. Then my friends started getting it and hated it. The salmon was red, should be a lighter pink, and the tuna didn't taste good, they said it was horrible. Today I got a simple California roll and shumai. In the sushi you could taste that the crab was fake, also me and friends ate the same thing and have the worst stomachache.

"Out of the hundreds of Colombian restaurants you can go to in downtown Union City this is not one that I would recommend. It is not the best type of food, although you will still get a hefty amount for your money and it is inexpensive.

My coworker and I ordered two breakfast platters at around 730PM, seeing as breakfast is served all day we didn't think that would be a problem. Our order took an hour and 45 minutes to arrive!!!! HORRIBLE. On top of that, the person on the phone didn't seem to care at all, he kept saying soon soon soon and we kept waiting waiting waiting. He also told us that we wouldn't be charged for the waters for the wait, when in fact, we were. There were no forks napkins or plates in the bag.

"Incredibly slow and overpriced.

I spent $12 for a lame schwarma wrap that was so small after I ate mine, I went out and ate a second from Wrapido around the corner for $9 that was bigger and much more flavorful.

Even after my friend politely tipped her, she still was rude! The crazy part was when i found out this place charges FOR EVERYTHING separately!, for tea, for salad, etc. Again, please don't let this taste of food fool you! if you're looking for good Uzbek food, This is NOT the place to go! and I hate to say it but this is an embarrassment for a place that supposedly serves Uzbek food! <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews provided, here are the actionable insights for restaurant improvement:

Still hungry. Such a waste. So much for hospitality. // The bar was empty and it still took the bartender over 10 minutes and us calling him over to get drinks. We then had to also get his attention again to order oysters. No one knew where the oysters were from, finally the 3rd person was able to inform us. If you want a real steakhouse experience I would go elsewhere. // They need at least two bartenders. One guy can't make drinks for the whole restaurant and tend to his bar customers. Fail.

"I've tried five different items from their menu, and although it's hard to hate them when they're so reasonably priced and generous with portion sizes, none of the ingredients are of very good quality. It's not bad, nothing is horrible, but nothing is exemplary or excellent. To be honest, nothing is even very good, but if you want extra mediocre ginger and extra mediocre wasabi, they'll gladly accomidate. Also, their delivery people are lighting fast and extremely friendly, though that's not reason enough for me to ever order from them again. There's better elsewhere, although this area is definitely lacking superior alternatives. // Basic and bad. Fish seemed old, rice was bad. I've had sushi served on a conveyor belt that was better than this. <|summary|> - Consider improving the quality of your ingredients, as customers find them to be not very good and none of the items sampled stood out as exceptional.

Well once I arrived I placed my ordered before another person (mind you, we both oreded the same food) one of the guys who cooks the food which he had his back turned towards me. There were two guys (the cook and the guy who takes the orders.) One told me it'll be ready in 7 minutes which took longer and the girl after me got her food first. The cachapa de pollo tasted like tuna plus the guy didn't seem nice.

"The worst peruvian restaurant EVER! =0 the worst service EVER! Don't waste your time and money in here. There are better place to go // This place use to be one of the best, now the rotisserie chicken has no peruvian flavor or seasonings, which is what makes peruvian chicken special.

"Maybe this passes for quality Mexican out in Rockaway. This place wouldn't stand a chance in Ridgewood, Sunset Park, or Flushing. I had an al pastor burrito (marinated and grilled pork) it was almost tasteless- no fresh salsa, bad sour cream, it was also really moist and watery. Not good things in a burrito. Also, the waitstaff seemed off in their own world, I tried speaking with them in Spanish when I ordered, they acted annoyed that I even tried. It was all in all a bad experience. Won't be back. I suggest looking further down in the 90's for decent sit down restaurants. Or drive out of Rockaway when you want quality Mexican. <|summary|> Based on the provided customer reviews, here are some actionable insights for improvement:

"I'm a bit confused as to what this place is trying to be. They say they bring food and drink from all over the globe but all 24 beers are from NJ (not that I am not into supporting our state, it just doesn't fit with their supposed vision). The menu is not very exciting and some items are overpriced (I.e. Almost $9 for a tiny basket of soggy fries). The cab on tap was undrinkable but the super Tuscan was good. The staff was friendly and helpful but I just don't see myself coming back for food. Also, they have no happy hour specials, which almost every successful restaurant around here does. <|summary|> - Clarify the restaurant's theme or concept, as there is confusion about the overall vision, specifically pertaining to the global cuisine advertised versus the local beer selection.

"Walked in. Looked at the menu. Walked right out. 'Nuff saud. This isn't Viet food and for them to claim that it is is a joke. Only non-asians don't know the difference hence why the rave reviews. Poor example of a Viet restaurant. // Overall unimpressed with the two dishes I ordered for delivery, which were the Vietnamese Sandwich and Grains of the Day w/ Beef Bacon and Pickled Egg.The food didn't taste Vietnamese and overall was pretty flavorless, even with the daily sauces. Also didn't help that the delivery took 2 hours. <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews, here are the actionable insights for improvement:

"Was a lot better years ago. Food mediocre. Beer choices need to be expanded. Haven't stayed current with competitors in the same space. // The food has dropped in quality the last 2 times we've gone. The Sliced Steak Sandwich is ehh at best.

My friend had a burger and I had the ribs. We didn't like it. It was overlooked and dry. I had high expectation for it hearing a lot of locals talk about it but I was disappointed. It seems to be a local's weeknight joint with a nice atmosphere. I can see why Bloomfield people would like it. It's not a foodies destination. // Two stars for the cheap drink prices and wide range of the hours their open. Very good ribbs on Wed/Thurs only.

"I'm sorry to have to leave such a bad review for this place, since it recently opened. I have to start by saying, is it possible to maybe cut most of the fat off of the chicken before cooking it? And ordering brown rice(which every place charges extra for, which I'm ok with)was definitely a little undercooked. In conclusion of my review of this place, I finished eating the meal due to being hungry, but wound up with a stomach ache, and being a little nauseous.

I expected to wait maybe 20 minutes if the kitchen was slammed. By the time my order was ready, I was already grumpy. When I tried the food, it was bland and soaked in grease.

Ok, the rice was good but not Mexican and the chicken was all dark meat and fat and gross. I had two bites and had to take Tums and my stomach was upset all night.

"1 star for the Seinfeld appeal (externally only); 1 for the different crowd it brings to the Heights; 0 stars for the food (a faint half star for the ""famous"" shake) and being cash only with a register Nazi--average late-night diner spot. Survives on its reputation as Monk's, and I wouldn't step foot inside unless I was a fan of the show. At this point, they put forth the amount of effort necessary, zero, to get by.

Screaming. Everything is an overpriced, satirical version of what you thought you were ordering (kielbasa in the ""Italian"" sandwich?), and you'll stand there for twenty minutes to get it.

The sandwiches are now sloppily put together and skimpy on bacon and other meat. I've been so disappointed the last few time I went. // Order food from there like at 4:00am got home and wasn't able to eat what I Order and the food is too salty...

"Why so rude and surly, morning crew? My experience here couldn't have been farther from a bisou (kiss in French). Also they must use sweetened almond milk for their coffee because it was almost undrinkable once I added my usual tiny bit of sugar, though it was a good size and decently priced if you're not discriminating about the quality of the drink.

We couldnt eat. Adana kebab was awful as well. Big disappointment!! // Restaurant re-opened and they were very disorganized.

I can't put my finger on one particular thing, but the food just doesn't taste good. Compared to some of similar establishments in the area, they are a little more expensive. They also have a credit card minimum, which is a problem if you're looking to just grab a coffee, breakfast sandwich, yogurt, etc. and are out of cash.

"They need to take the word ""cafe"" down. This is an upgraded West Indian restaurant serving from a steam table. No you cannot have a seat and sip your coffee comfortably and get work done. They do not have a wide enough selection of pastries nor caffeinated drinks. Bagged Lipton tea and a pot of burnt or watered down coffee. I'm so bothered by this I watched the buildout and was very excited to see a coffee shop finally come to the neighborhood. <|summary|> - Consider rebranding to better reflect the restaurant's upscale culinary offerings, suggesting that the establishment is more than a simple ""cafe.""

"Food is kind of cold. There are flies. Good price. I would suggest that they cover the turon. I love turon and was thinking about getting it but I'm seeing how easily people could breathe on it or flies could touch it dissuaded me. It was also quite dark. Decor is meh-- it could definitely use a facelift. Overall a very mediocre turo-turo place. // Bumili ako ng lumpia shanghai at fried rice. Yung lumpia panis na.

"First timer and won't come back. The atmosphere emits ""locals only"" and the decor is a sad attempt at rustic/vintage. Just uncomfortable. I ordered a medium Chai latte for $4.25. It was all foam and lukewarm water! She wouldn't even put a lid on my order after I told the clerk it was to-go. She scoffed and handed me the lid! // 0 stars, just came here for a chai and it taste horrible!!! Will update soon after i finish with the coconut cake... Update: ok the coconut cake was delicious but stay away from their ice Chai, still 0 stars because i paid a lot for this, and they only take cash. <|summary|> - Improve the atmosphere of the restaurant to feel more welcoming, as it currently emits a ""locals only"" vibe and the decor seems to be an unsuccessful attempt at rustic/vintage.

"Fucking annoying place all foods are tasteless n that one blade man is crazy n mannerless don't know how to deal with customers. Go to hell // I dropped in here and had the Chicken Thali or the Chicken combo platter. I would definitely take no one here to have this plate.

It may be helpful to delve deeper into each of these points with staff training, menu revision, and customer service improvements to resolve these issues."
"Just tried this place and was sorely disappointed. Went for the Shawarma platter thinking it would be lamb, but got chicken. It was dry and bland tasting, the salad was uninspired and a little rank. Portion was way too small for the $9 and had to wait in line for 10 minutes (too long for a cart). I won't be back. <|summary|> - Address customer expectations by ensuring menu descriptions are accurate, particularly with the Shawarma platter where lamb was expected but chicken was served.

"Been here one time. The atmosphere was okay at first. Drinks are way to expensive, especially this side or town. $15 for a soco and coke is just wrong, especially when you will pay less than half that at the bar next door. The staff I found to be rude and pushy. If you are not planning on continuously adding to your tab, they treat you like crap. Also heard about the sisters or mercy party that la lune canceled on at the last minute. Not surprised, and we can take our business elsewhere. // I wish I could give this establishment less than A single star. The manager is as dishonest and vile as they come.

"This place seems like it's out of business but still manages to hang on somehow, rarely anyone goes there a lot now but I did the other night. I ordered 9 piece chicken and I told the guy I didn't want wings because well they would do those cheap skate things and give me 7 wings probably and 4 pieces of actual thighs and breast etc. After I said that he charged me an extra $1 which I did not get why I have to pay more for something that clearly says 9 piece chicken for $11. How cheap. <|summary|> - The restaurant appears to be struggling with low patronage, as suggested by the comment on its seeming out-of-business status and the observation that few people visit it now.

"Just got some shahi paneer. And it tasted very bland. No ""shahi"" part about it, just paneer. First time there, but I don't think I will be going there again. // Two days I showed up for their lunch buffet and they had just decided not to set it up for those days. Unforgivable since people make plans. I was given a card to call in advance but when I tried the number, no one was answering. On the days I did have the buffet, I was impressed and would have become a regular customer but if you get there after 1:30 p.m. and some food items are gone, they don't replace them. Plus, no dessert offered as part of the buffet. For 3 dollars more, I would go to Jassi's. In fact, the owners of King of India should go to Jassi's to see the setup. It might inspire them to do a little better. <|summary|> - Review the recipe for shahi paneer and enhance the flavor profile to ensure it meets customer expectations of a traditional ""shahi"" dish.

"Wow. So I walked in and offered ""fiver"" for a sandwich that was $7.50 (Monday 5/3 evening). They agreed, or at least I thought so. When I paid for the sandwich, turned out that there was a misunderstanding over the price. Ok, fine. Misunderstandings happen. Then they refused to refund and then didn't give me my change. I guess if $10 is more important to you than being fair to your customers, here is the lowest review I can give you gents for your lack of ethics and I suggest everyone stays away.

"I was really excited when I saw the reviews for a cheap breakfast place. I love dives and diner/breakfast food. Total waste of a morning. Maybe this would be fine not on a weekend, but we sat for forty minutes waiting for two sandwiches and over easy eggs. Then I asked for the check and waited and waited and waited as they helped everyone around us. I finally just put twenty bucks down on the counter and left. // Worst turkey burger I have ever seen!

"I ordered tofu and rice and beans from them off GrubHub and it was the most bland meal I've ever had.Honestly, there was no flavor, everything was just soft. I'll probably never order from here again considering I was expecting some good Caribbean food not taste-less clumps of food. // 2 hours for delivery. They delivered well after they closed. We had to call grubhub to find out what happened and were told that the delivery person was in traffic. Of course being so late the food wasn't hot. It didn't really taste great either.

"Overpriced/small portion/terrible service - just don't waste your time waiting in a line to get the mediocre food // I was attending an event at Columbia University earlier this month and went to this cafe and bought a square of crumb cake. The cake was completely dry and stale; it didn't taste fresh, so I complained to a worker behind the counter there, who in turn, directed me to the owner of the cafe. After eyeing my cleavage with his beady eyes (he barely looked at my face), the owner was completely dismissive of my complaint. I guess he was in a hurry!

"Bought a strawberry, banana nutella whipped cream crepe here. The strawberry was from a can. 4 small strawberries, half a banana, nutella was drizzled on, whipped cream and powdered sugar was added onto the crepe. For $8, I expected it to not taste so artificial and overly sweet. Very disappointing crepe. // Came here for a quick bite and shared a vegetable crepe. They used frozen vegetables which were very bland. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from a crepe place in a fast food court, but still felt this could have been done a little better. Would go to Nathan's instead if I was ever hungry in the food court at the Seaport. :) All that being said, when we left there were at least seven people waiting on line so maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. <|summary|> - Consider using fresh strawberries instead of canned ones to improve the quality of the strawberry, banana nutella whipped cream crepe and justify the $8 price.

"Disappointing. Falafel and veg really un-fresh. Tahini = mayo (saturated the entire dish). Served on a bed of rice.

"Stromboli's are great. But stay away awAy from the pizza!!! Who the hell puts corn meal on the bottom of the pizza. Definitely not my pizza. Shame on u guys // The buffalo wings were great size and flavor. However, I've never had as bland of a Alfredo sauce as they served. The Alfredo sauce was literally tasteless.

"I have gotten takeout from this place like 3 times since it has opened. The first time, I ordered rolls that had raw fish. Particularly, I got spicy salmon rolls (my favorite) and alaskan rolls. The spicy salmon was bland and the salmon in the alaskan rolls tasted odd. Perhaps the salmon not being fresh could be an explanation for the odd taste...? But after the first time, I learned that it my best bet would be to stick to california rolls and such because you can't possibly F those up right? So the other two visits I made were strictly for ""cooked"" rolls. Overall, this place is just meh. If you're a person who adheres to ""quantity over quality"", I guess you can give this place a go since they have a 30% thing going on until 12/31. <|summary|> Actionable insights from the customer reviews:

"Food isn't prepared. Walked in and told nothing is ready yet. Funny because their hours say 12:00 pm open. 45 minutes after that and food isn't ready. Really? Guess I'll have to check your competition. Peace the fuck out. PS. You know this is the kind of place to that if you come back a couple hours later they're gonna be out of everything that you want. So basically if you get there on time they won't be open if you show up later they're not gonna have anything you want. // Horrible customer service!

"This is an update. While we had very positive experiences when we go there in person, orders taken online turns up in worst way imaginable. We ordered veggie lunch box, paneer kathi roll online and we were given just rice & dhal, no veggies. We called up the store, the owner was not there btw and some other guys who spoke told no veggies today, only dhal. whaaaaat ?ok then we thought we will find solace atleast in the roll only to find roti stale and paneer all chewy and leathery.

"I have been going to Petridis all my life. Even when new owners bought it and it changed to George's I'd still go, and often defend it to others. No more The last time the woman behind the counter was painfully slow, had to ask multiple times what I wanted in a short span of time (it was 3 plain hot dogs and one with red onions--easy stuff). If I knew how long it would take her to deal with the two customers before me I would have walked out. She seemed miserable having to be there and that made me miserable for stopping in to get a few dogs. Next time I'll go to the guy on Ave E when I get a hot dog craving // Food is putrid canned not fresh and really gross ...

The last thing you will ever get is a smile with your purchase ! Will update review in a few weeks when hopefully they can get their act together. // I love their bread and cake. But the cashiers are not friendly. They take so long for one customer. Don't care if there is a line. And the worst thing, they put the tart sideway.. I bought berry tart $6.95. Looks really delicious. Because they put it sideways, berries drops in the container, shape is not as it is sold any more.

"The place went down hill... stopped giving me my deal... and look what happened... went out of business... hopefully somewhere else will open up there to give me my daily intake of babganoush! // I ordered a shawarma wrap and a baklava for delivery. It took about an hour or so to be delivered. By the time it got to my office I was starving and didn't care if it was good or not, I just needed to eat. The shawarma wrap was burrito sized, which is good, but the flavor was nothing special. I've had way better shawarmas in my life, in smaller towns. The baklava left me completely perplexed. It was more of a peanut butter cookie than the usual baklava's that I've had (and trust me I've had a lot). It was good, but just not a baklava for me. Maybe in old Jerusalem they loved their peanut butter. <|summary|> - Consider exploring regional preferences or updating the menu to meet customer expectations, as one customer was disappointed with the familiarity of the flavors and mentioned having better experiences in smaller towns.

"Ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with the papa fritas (fries) and salad and it was ok the good thing is that the meat was tender but the skin was not crispy but like rubbery so we could not eat the skin. the salad was put through a shredder and not a salad proper they did not include any salad dressing. the chicken came with a hot sauce and a regular sauce but it was not salad dressing. also the salad had maybe 3 slices of cucumber in it and had to be thrown out as I mistakenly thought the hot and spicy chicken sauce was the salad dressing.

"Randomly found this place as my friend and I were looking for a place near the park where we could just grab a sandwich and then head back to soak up some Vitamin D in the park. The staff wasn't overly friendly; she definitely answered our questions and gave us food recommendations (as we were struggling to decide). But her personality didn't seem to match the charming, openness of the restaurant.

"Horrid. How does one mess up General Tso's Chicken and an egg roll. Bad Chinese food in this day and age is just an insult. This is NY! You are obligated by law to make great take-out. There must be a law or something. And if not the next mayor must put it on his/her agenda right this minute!! Never again. // We ordered from here quite a few times when we first moved to the neighborhood - not because it was good, but for lack of options. The best thing was definitely the lo mein, which is not hard to do. And that wasn't even exciting. However, all take out and delivery came to a screeching halt when my roommate found a giant (over an inch) cockroach in her lo mein. The poor girl almost bit it! Never again. <|summary|> Based on the given reviews, here is a summary of actionable insights for the restaurant:

- Improve the quality of General Tso's Chicken and egg roll as the customer found it poorly made and not up to standard.
- Address issues with the quality of Chinese food being served to ensure it meets the expectations for a New York-based restaurant.
- Evaluate and enhance the overall menu offerings, as the customer sought other options due to a lack of good choices at the restaurant.
- Ensure the Lo Mein dish is prepared consistently and make it more exciting, since it was considered the best item but still not remarkable.
- Investigate and rectify any hygiene issues urgently, as a guest found a large cockroach in their Lo Mein, which is unacceptable and could severely damage the restaurant's reputation.
- Guarantee that all food delivery and take-out practices are safe and clean to prevent any similar incidents in the future.
- Take customer feedback seriously and consider making immediate improvements to avoid losing clientele, since customers expressly stated they would not return after their experience.

These insights should prompt a thorough quality check and an immediate response plan to handle the negative feedback regarding food quality and hygiene."
"Ordered a steakhouse salad for $5. I expected a small salad but instead I got a large pile of garbage. I expected a small amount of steak and got a small amount of thin shreds of steak pieces. If you do not say anything to the person making your salad, all you get are Iceberg lettuce with your steak. The steak subs are ok. <|summary|> - Review and possibly revise the steakhouse salad's description to manage customer expectations regarding salad size and steak portion.

- Continue to engage with customers and encourage them to try different menu items, while also considering their feedback for menu improvements."
"Just horrible because the food isn't served on time and the servants are rude. Plus that the people that cook the food probably dropped some hair in the food since I found hair in my food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone // Terrible restaurant. Beef stew was watery and came in a small portion for an entree. The white rice and beans on the side seemed devoid of seasoning. The peril which is a staple of any Latin restaurant didn't have much of any flavor at all. When a Latin restaurant can't get rice and beans and pork right they should take some time to re-evaluate themselves. To top it all off the they didn't have any water. WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE WATER??? Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. ZERO STARS <|summary|> - Ensure food is served on time to improve customer satisfaction.
- Address staff rudeness by retraining or admonishing as necessary.

"Not for those that don't take spices, as myself. Even with the very mild heat that was requested, it was still too spicy for me. But good value for lunch. Comes w/ a small box of kottu, a small side & soda. // Idk if it was just me but the lentil patties are so exceedingly dry I could barely choke down one without reaching for water. // I don't know what I just ate, but it was really bad. // Spies tasted too raw and dry. Not recommended for those looking for Sri Lankan kottu. Coffee flan looks like Cat Food. <|summary|> - Review your spice levels in dishes, even those requested to be very mild; they may still be too spicy for some customers.
- Ensure that lentil patties are not overly dry, which could be difficult for customers to eat without water.
- Assess the preparation of the spiced dishes to avoid the impression that they are raw and dry.

- Evaluate customer experience consistency to address individual complaints for improvement."
"Ok, so clearly the people who are reviewing this place have never had a decent ""platter"" or ""burger."" I was so excited that we finally have a platter/gyro joint around the area, but I must say this is only worth it when your all out of options. The burgers and platters seriously need some more depth and flavoring and the prices badly need to be reduced. The drive to Juicy Platters in Fairlawn or New York (for real street food) is seriously considered before coming here. // Had a rock in my lettuce, needless to say I will not be eatting there anymore. This is very unfortunate because the food is usually excellent. <|summary|> - Consider reviewing and enhancing the flavor and quality of the burgers and platters served.
- Reevaluate pricing to ensure that it aligns better with the value and quality of the food offered.

- Review and adjust the salt levels in the tacos to ensure they are properly seasoned.
- Evaluate the guacamole recipe to ensure an appropriate balance of flavors; reduce the amount of salsa verde and lemon juice if they are overpowering.

- Consider customer feedback seriously and make appropriate changes to the menu items or recipes as multiple elements were found unsatisfactory.
- While the chips were reported to be satisfactory, they might need more salt according to the customer's palette. However, this may need confirmation as the same reviewer found the tacos too salty."
"I usually order from here once a week because the food is always great however the last 2 weeks the food has not been good. Last week it was ok but today it was terrible. It tasted like they cooked it last week. Maybe they have a different cook on Friday but this has made me not want to order from here again. <|summary|> - Maintain consistent food quality as a frequent customer noticed a decline in the past two weeks.
- Investigate potential changes or inconsistencies in the cooking process, especially on Fridays, which might be linked to different staff or cooks.

"Bar service is lacking. The prices really don't seem like happy hour... and they don't seem to do buy backs... 6 drinks and nothing. Nice staff. // Food was blah...nothing special...The cuban bread was stale. The garlic shrimp needed garlic and a fresh sauce. It was a gelatonous glob of yellow goo. The tostones with chicken was the highlight. The guacamole was just ok. I will not return. I should have waited the 30 minutes for Dinosaur... // Like so many other things in Harlem, LATELY, Floridita was EXTREMELY disappointing!!! As this was my first time here, I will say that the King fish I ordered came out as a bread pan fried filet that tasted like swamp water raised tilapia. I have these two stars for the black beans and the service. NOT REAL CUBAN FOOD, VERY DISAPPOINTED!! <|summary|> - Improve bar service to address reports of it lacking.
- Reevaluate pricing strategy, considering feedback that prices do not reflect the value, especially during happy hour, and that there seem to be no incentives like buybacks.

"I don't find this place to be anything special. Food was very salty. I ordered #18 and the sauce tasted like ragu tomato sauce. It was mostly a rice portion with a side of stewed beef and iceberg lettuce. Overall, expensive for $14. By the way- their guacamole has no tomatoes. It does have egg boiled egg. I do not recommend. The Salvadoran cheese does not taste like feta as advertised in their menu. Also, I originally order a cheese pupusa and they didn't have. Ended up with a mixed bean and cheese. I don't feel like they make them fresh like other Salvadoran delis I have visited. I would go to Ranchito Deli or El Vincentino Restaurante Salvadoreno or venture into Queens Village. Their horchata is water-based not milk based. <|summary|> - Review the salt levels in dishes; customers have found the food too salty.
- Reevaluate Menu Item #18; particularly, assess the sauce to ensure it is distinct and not reminiscent of generic ragu tomato sauce.
- Consider adjusting the portion size of the rice and enhancing the accompanying side items for better value, as the current $14 price point was perceived as expensive by a customer.
- Reassess the ingredients in the guacamole; customers may expect to see traditional ingredients like tomatoes rather than substitutions like boiled eggs.
- Inspect the taste and advertising of the Salvadoran cheese to ensure that it meets customer expectations and aligns with the menu's description, specifically the feta cheese claim.
- Review inventory and menu accuracy based on the unavailability of cheese pupusas; ensure that items listed on the menu are in stock or remove them temporarily if they cannot be provided.
- Examine the freshness and preparation methods of staple Salvadoran dishes against customer expectations and competition, to possibly improve on authenticity and taste.
- Investigate alternatives to milk bases in drinks like horchata if current offerings deviate from traditional recipes, ensuring that descriptions are accurate to customer expectations.

Overall, the review indicates dissatisfaction with the food's authenticity, taste, and value for money. This suggests that improving ingredient quality, recipe authenticity, and menu accuracy could enhance the dining experience."
"Nice service here but, much like nearby Wawa Canteen, patronage should be releaged to harried or lazy NYU students. The falafel/hummus/tabouli trio was fairly priced at $7.75 but was unremarkable. The three falafel were huge but bland and the outside v inside were texturally indistinguishable. Kind of felt like a meatball or matzohball in that regard. The hummus and tabouli were both decent but not worth a special trip. For falafel, go up a block to Maoz or venture to Cafe Rakka, Mamoun's, Cinderella, or even University Pita before this place. <|summary|> - Improve falafel flavor and texture; customers find them large but bland and indistinguishable.

- Consider exploring new recipes or variations to compete with local options such as Maoz, Cafe Rakka, Mamoun's, Cinderella, or University Pita."
"The lady can be pretty rude and rush the living hell out of you. Not welcoming or even pleasant at all , just a ""give me your money "" attitude. Like seriously if I just walk in and it's been two seconds chill out. If you ask her about prices you will get so much attitude and lip. The food is usually decent I hate her service so I tell everyone not to go here or order in general. <|summary|> - Address staff behavior issues immediately; a customer perceived a female staff member as rude and unwelcoming.

"I ordered delivery with a variety of sushi and rolls. The fish is terrible! It was not fresh, smelly and disgusting. Near the end of my meal I ended up just eating the rice because it was so bad. The only thing that was decent was the eel. Their rice has an overpowering amount of lemon juice in it. I wouldn't eat here even if it was free, let alone for the price I paid for it. I only eat at cheap sushi places and this is the worst sushi I ever had. Additionally I live super close to the store, like 10 min walk tops and it took over an hour to get my food. // The worst service you can ever get it took 40 mins extra to deliver ans the send the sushi without soy sauce // Terrible service, with cold food and slow delivery. <|summary|> - Address and improve the freshness and quality of the fish used in sushi and rolls.

- Consider offering compensation beyond a free can of soda when a mistake occurs or when customers are dissatisfied."
"The one star I gave was only because of the requirement. The food was horrifyingly bad and not fresh. 5 bucks for a cup of coke. 8 dollars for a scoop of ice cream. The incredibly rude owner won't leave your table alone until he pushes more and more disgusting food. The buffet is always empty. Expect to pay well over 100 dollars for 2 people. Oh... and the required 18% tip? When the waiter is the owner? Laughable. <|summary|> - Improve food quality and ensure freshness as customers found it ""horrifyingly bad.""

"Don't waste your money when there is a perfectly delicious deli one avenue west. The roast beef on my sandwich tasted old, and the canned soda that ""came with"" my sandwich (meaning they just charge more) was covered in dirt and grime on the tab. I was forced to throw both out and be without a lunch. Not a happy camper! // Wow, walked in here with my girlfriend and the middle eastern guy behind the counter looks at my girlfriend and says ""Japanese? Korean? Welcome to America!""

"I really wanted to like this place. I'm all for trying to support black owned establishments in ever-gentrifying Bed Stuy. But the food here was just not good. The bbq chicken was serviceable. The sides were devoid of seasonings or real flavor. The mac and cheese was mushy to the point of being more of a pudding consistency. It tasted like mush and cheese. Very disappointing. Where was the milk, eggs, salt, pepper? Something? Anything? Then there were the greens (sigh). The only thing I tasted was the tang of vinegar. Even if you don't use pork for flavoring (smoked turkey is a great alternative), where were the other seasonings? Unfortunately, I would not even consider returning here. <|summary|> - Improve seasoning and flavor profiles for side dishes.
- Address consistency and texture for the mac and cheese, aiming for a less mushy consistency.

"We came to this Lulo because normally we love the one in Washington heights but it's always packed. We were told it's the same food so we decided to drive here instead and what a mistake that was, first of all it was 7pm and they had NOTHING! How are you a restaurant but you don't have anything cooked yet? And to top it all off what we did get (rice and chicken) was horrible and felt like it had been sitting out for days! So disappointed, we'll stick to the one in the heights not here! <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews provided, here are some actionable insights for you as the restaurant owner:

And on top of that, we waited 30 minutes for the matcha shawty and crack me up. The matcha shawty was green tea ice cream with strawberries. They put kiwis instead.... And the green tea ice cream tasted bitter. It was not satisfying. The crack me up was strawberry ice cream with graham crackers. It ended up being animal crackers.....very disappointed.

"The beignets were soooooo good. But the chicken potpie was awful. Burger was so meh. Felt sort of disgusted after that whole meal. Like, wait wtf did I just put in my body?

"Mehhhhh I'm here after 6am on a Sunday when you are supposed to be open as per your posted hours. I'm hungry!!!! Fail // Yeah, not really that good of a joint. The servers are sweet and nice.

"This place was ok. I wouldnt mind giving them another try, because i came just a little after opening. I was the first costumer, and I guess they weren't prepared. I ordered the fish and shrimp tacos. I asked for the fish, and shirmp to be grilled but had gotten them fried. All the taco had was the fish, a little bit a coleslaw and a tomatoe. Which was kinda disapointing, and flavoreless. You can add hot sauce and tartar sauce for some flavor. You can barely taste any seasoning, all I could taste is the fryer they probably used to cook the fish and shrimp in. For my first experience I was very disappointed especially after reading these great reviews but I will give it another try. Definitely not so early. <|summary|> - Be prepared for the first customer of the day to avoid giving the impression of unpreparedness.

"I've heard lots of great stuff about this restaurant. The owner is very personable and the plates that I'd seen looked good so I was really looking forward to having a meal here. I decided to try the Whaler - a whiting sandwich. It was the worst fish sandwich I've ever paid for in my life. No exaggeration. I waited too long for it and when it came out it was cold, sloppy and overcooked. I was so disappointed but so hungry. I couldn't even finish it. If someone offered to treat me to a meal at this restaurant, I'd give it another shot. // Yams were good. Mac it wasnt anything special. The wings were so tiny it was hard to really enjoy them but it had a nice flavor.

"I haven't had a chance to try their other foods so this review is only for the soy milk. Conclusion: don't buy their soy milk.

"The owner could not have been nicer, and I was very excited to find a dedicated GF bakery, so I purchased a loaf of banana bread & the baguette bread. Unfortunately, the $12 banana bread was extremely dry & had a glob of baking soda or baking powder in the bottom corner of the loaf, unbeknownst to me, & I bit into it for a bitter surprise. I really wanted to give the food more stars but I don't think it would be accurate to do so. // Just got a second message from the owner. In this one he is telling me to do things the right way and fix this review because it is hurting a small artisinal bakery. I found the products gritty.

"A colleague and I went there for lunch. It is very small and clean. We were the only people there. The food was well prepared and presented. Our waiter was attentive, but as we were the only customers, that wasn't difficult. There was no ambience and not at all memorable. Overall it was a decent meal, but I don't think I will be back anytime soon. // The food is decent but the service is pretty bad.

"A few months ago, I tried out Le Frappe for lunch. While I enjoyed the hummus crepe I ordered and found the space and decor to be charming, the woman who served me was incredibly unfriendly. Share barely greeted me and didn't thank me at all for my patronage. And I was one of only two patrons at that moment. The other was an elderly man who didn't order anything and just sat at a table reading his newspaper and cracking open some peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor. She talked to him, but all but ignored me.

"It took an hour for my soup and grandma slice to get to me so naturally my pizza was cold. I was only a few blocks from them! Other than that, it would have been delicious. I also found my tortellini soup extremely watery. It was nice that they don't (or don't really as per the gentleman on the phone) have a minimum for delivery but I'm not too ecstatic about this place. <|summary|> Here are the actionable insights from the customer reviews:

"This is possibly the worst sushi I've had in my life. The delivery was quick however the fish looked artificial and tasted so bland. Even the tuna roll tasted like it was starting to spoil. Had the salmon avocado salad and even had a hard time swallowing that. How did this place get so many good reviews on seamless?? // I don't know if I got a bad batch of sushi or what but my fish tasted like it was starting to spoil. The color of the fish were bright orange/red however, which makes me question the quality of the fish and whether it was dipped in a pool of food coloring.

"Celebrated my friends birthday at the restaurant. We had a party of 16 people, two people were violently sick with vomiting and diarrhea and two including myself had stomach cramps nausea and upset stomach for two days. The food portions where very small, even the beat salad which hardly costs anything to make was only enough for half the table.

"This is disgusting. Usually, when I'm auditioning a new Asian place, I will start with the Paad Thai as a base of reference. This place couldn't even get that right. The noodles are sitting in a pool of thin brown sauce. There is almost no flavor and the chicken is rubbery. It's just awful. If I wasn't so hungry today, I'd probably just throw it out. Good-bye, Good Portions. You won't be getting a second chance. <|summary|> - Review the quality and preparation of the Pad Thai, as it failed to meet the customer's standard for an Asian restaurant.

We had called the night before and planned for the food to be delivered by 1pm.

"Super friendly staff are very pleasant which is good thing since their version of thai food is akin to how MacDonald's burgers compare to Pat LaFrieda's. Hopefully their Japanese and Chinese menu items are a bigger hit or they get better help in the kitchen, otherwise this spot will be among the sad, closed storefronts on that block. <|summary|> - Continue to maintain and highlight the super friendly staff and pleasant customer service as a key strength.

"We used to eat here before I checked the restaurant inspections. Their fried chicken was really good at one time too. Their house special fried rice and even regular fried rices used to have EGG and sprouts in it with green onion and peas... now you only get onion in your fried rice. And the rice is super brown and greasy, what's up w/ that? It seems like they refuse to change the oil there cuz the chicken is dark brown and dry now, when it used to be golden crisp, plump and yummy. I'm not ordering from there again, what's the point if the other person behind the wok doesn't give a who-ha about the person who worked for about 3 hours to earn that 5 minute meal. <|summary|> Actionable insights based on customer reviews:

- Review the cooking oil change schedule to ensure the quality of fried foods, such as chicken, isn’t compromised. The chicken previously described as ""golden crisp"" is now ""dark brown and dry.""

"Horrible bitter espresso. Undrinkable. Food items appear packaged and not homemade. No reason to come here instead of a corner deli. // Super crappy espresso... My latte was so bitter and kinda watered down. Also the wifi here is really spotty so don't plan on getting anything done. The beef chili was ok. // Fair coffee, but far from great...kinda' weak...given the ratings, you must need to get crafted beverage, as the brewed earns no 4 stars. Breakfast sandwich was horrible.

"One star because they are cash only and no working ATM. They sell food and alcohol and hold parties there but no one walks around with mounds of cash on them anymore. // It's very very loud here and not cozy and cafe like at all. I'm not sure if calling it ghetto is the right thing, but it is, I wish someone had said this before and I wouldn't have gone.

"Couple months ago, I bought some pork jerky from this place one time - it was very tasty; moist and flavorful. So needlessly to say I wanted more of it, just that I haven't had the time to venture to chinatown to buy more. So fast forward, I came here again with couple friends. Bam, right there behind the glass case housing the jerky craws a little cockroach. a 2 inch COCKROACH. I told the guy behind the counter - hey you have a cockroach with your jerky. He looked at me as if it's business-as-usual. // Not what I remember it to be :( I remember going in 2009 and it was sweet and tender. This time around, the pork jerky was wayyyy too tenderized and was almost mushy.

"Came here for a late lunch and was expecting a great meal because of all the awesome reviews. The place was pretty much empty when I got there, but I wasn't really surprised at that since it's winter time and it was very close to 3 pm already. Service was really attentive. The waitress filled my cup with some warm broth right away. However, the broth wasn't really that good and I asked for some tea/water instead. Ordered the spicy cold noodle with raw fish. Sauce on cold noodle was way too sweet and severely lacking in sesame oil. The whole thing was extremely disappointing. If it wasn't for the service and the side dishes, it honestly would've been just a one star kind of experience... Won't be coming back... <|summary|> - Consider reviewing the broth quality, as a customer found it underwhelming.

"This is probably the most unorganized deli I have ever went to. They cannot seem to get a simple egg and cheese not toasted right (3rd time they have screwed up my order). They toast all rolls to try to mask that the bread is half stale and the quality of the finished product is eh. It takes forever to finally get your order- remember, check to see if it's right. The only reason I have come here is because just a few doors down chicken deli mysteriously closed (which was phenomenal) and its right across the street from my office.

"Waited very long for service, waited long for food. Food was cold and bland. A grilled cheese is not the usual kind. Found out they serve fish, so they are not vegetarian they are pescatarian (fish eaters) falsely named vegetarian. Would never go back there. // Horrible costumer service!

"If you love cumin, flat beer, and New York Times hyped up quality. This is the place for you. // Well, on the bright side, the borscht was good. On the other hand, they were out of ingredients for half the menu and also their signature cocktail; despite the fact that my friend and I were one of two tables in an otherwise empty restaurant, our entrees were delivered twenty minutes apart, the bread was served covered in chunks of barely-cooked garlic, the pierogi were frozen and poorly thawed, the service was surly, and we were double-charged on an item.

"Disappointed, unfortunately. Downtown Ise was so much better. It looks that they tried to upscale the restaurant; looks good, but food are so-so. You will know how many customer they are having (not many). You do not even need reservation. Fish quality is not as they put the price for. Their market price Sashimi was NOT good. So Americanized how they cut the fish! Fat isn't always good, we want quality. Even grilled fish (Hokke) was not flesh enough (Japanese can tell by the smell). Drinks are limited. Soba noodle is good, yet, Soba dipping soup isn't. Over all, there are so much better place with less money. If you are only going there for the noodle, it could be acceptable.

"The menu for this sushi place looked very promising, but I never received the order because their delivery person seemed unable to find my building (prominently marked business address in Midtown). I wasted about an hour between waiting for the delivery person, who insisted he was there, and calling the restaurant to explain to them that he was *not* there. The restaurant owner kept trying to convince me that the delivery person was indeed there--very frustrating conversation. They could have simply sent someone else instead of trying to convince me he was there and I was just stupidly not seeing him. Way to lose customers--not good for a newly opened restaurant. <|summary|> - Ensure the delivery staff can accurately locate and reach the destination without confusion, possibly by improving their navigation tools or training.
- Improve communication between the restaurant and delivery staff to prevent customers from wasting time due to delivery errors.

"Great speakeasy atmosphere and piano bar, but the food and service was sub-par for the price. Stay away from the rubbery shrimp cocktail; lobster bisque was just ok; fried chicken was without seasoning and very bland; cornbread was beyond terrible; service was really bad. Very unimpressed. // Beautiful restaurant but awful service. We were seated at the same time as two other parties of two.

"I give this place 6 months! First we ordered the scallop app that was supposed to come with 6 scallops. When the waiter brought it over he said we only gave you four because they were really big, strike one. Then we waited 20 minutes for our two rolls with no one in the place, strike two. Next, the sushi came which after reading all the reviews. I was expecting to be amazed and make up for the first two strikes. Well, the sushi had no taste and barley any flavor, strike three.

"From reading the reviews it was our top choice for a last minute brunch option. The decor and locations are great but that where it ends. The coffee was not good, staff weren't that friendly, breakfast menu didn't have many options and the food that we had (French toast & chilaquiles, side of avocado toast) was ok but not worth the price.

"I had 2 orders of mozzarella sticks and their menu had said six pieces per order at 4 dollars each. It was a bit pricy but since I was craving them I was okay with that. But when they were delivered, each box only had 5 so I called them to let them know, only to the have the owner place the blame on the company that prints out their menu. In principle, he could've let me know beforehand since he seemed to know about the misprint or he could have fulfilled what his menu had advertised by simply adding a SINGLE mozzarella stick to each order. What got me mad was that he was arguing with me, failed to accept responsibility and did not issue an apology. I wish him the best but I will be taking my business to Gianni's, a nearby pizzeria on Northern Blvd. <|summary|> - Ensure that the number of items delivered matches the menu's advertised quantity (customers reported receiving 5 mozzarella sticks per order instead of the advertised 6).

"Food isn't even deserving of the single star. ABSOLUTE WORST FOOD EVER!!! Turkey burger tasted like solidified turkey broth, the cheese looked fake, Pamela Anderson has better plasticity than the cheese on this burger. Fries were burnt. They sent a second order to make up for the first, and it was just as bad. Rabid snakes living under the Kiliminjaro would slither past this rubbish.

I took a nice little side trip over here from uptown on saturday during lunch time hours. I wanted to try the empanadas that everyone was raving about. Bad idea. Like everyone says they run out of empanadas fast. I order the beef with cheese and the chicken empanada. The ones I got all smelled of old grease and tasted like that way also. It seemed like they never ever changed the oil from when the place first opened up. It was terrible. How can this place get good reviews on their empanadas when they taste horrible.

"So I've had my third visit here and I will not returning. There was a wrong pricing on the menu and the ""owner"" was very rude about it. I am concerned about the hair that was in my food.

- Train staff on customer service best practices to prevent any future perceived rudeness.
- Monitor customer feedback continuously for further issues that need to be addressed."
"I dared to give this place a review because it was so awful.. The soup of the day must be the best thing they only have.. Don't get anything else because it will be money you are just going to throw away in the garbage.. And the service is terrible.. A new Salvadoran restaurant must be brought upon in this area.. Don't waste your time and money! // I work in Newark as an EMT covering 911 calls. I had gone into Las Canastillas to order some pupusas and waited as long as I could. At this point I had waited approximately 10 minutes before I had an assignment. The staff was nasty because I had to leave telling me that it's going to be 10 more minutes. When I did come back for the food, all of a sudden noone speaks English and the pupusas wasn't made. <|summary|> - The customer is extremely dissatisfied with their overall experience at the restaurant.
- The only item they found acceptable was the soup of the day, indicating other menu items may not meet customer expectations.
- The customer feels that any money spent on items other than the soup is wasted, as they imply that the food was not good enough to keep.
- Service quality is mentioned as terrible, suggesting the need for staff training and improvement in customer interaction.
- The customer suggests there is a gap in the market for a Salvadoran restaurant in the area, potentially indicating a lack of variety or quality in the restaurant's current offerings.
- Long wait times were experienced, specifically noted as 10 minutes before leaving for an assignment, without a satisfactory update on the wait time from staff, signaling potential issues in kitchen efficiency or front-of-house communication.
- Staff behavior was seen as unpleasant, particularly when the customer indicated they had to leave soon; staff made the customer wait longer and behaved poorly in response.
- There was a notable language barrier issue when the customer returned for their order, as no one spoke English at that time, complicating communication.
- There was an issue with order fulfillment, as the customer mentioned the food (pupusas) was not prepared.
  
Overall, the restaurant needs urgent improvements in customer service, menu item quality (beyond the soup), staff communication skills, language accommodation, and order preparation efficiency. Consider evaluating menu options, perhaps investigating the feasibility of introducing Salvadoran dishes, to diversify the appeal and address the market gap indicated by the customer."
"07/14/16 was one of the 3 weekdays @fgbbq is allegedly open @ 11, yet @ 11:46am the staffer nonchalantly said 'probably like 20more mins' with no apology or thanks. Get it together. 4 of your 8 reviews (all 5-stars, of course) are clearly fake. // Only because the hrs suck and they r closed today! No sign! Had to call and they closed for the season early. 4 times trying to go to this place. Soooo damn aggravated!!! To mighty Quinn I go!! <|summary|> Based on the fragmented and somewhat cryptic nature of the reviews provided, here are some assembled insights that can be discerned:

- The restaurant allegedly opens at 11 AM, but there was an incident where staff informed a customer of a delay (about 20 minutes) in service without offering an apology or thanks.
- There may be some skepticism regarding the authenticity of some of the restaurant's 5-star reviews, suggesting that a few might be fake.
- There is confusion about the business hours or the restaurant is not adhering to posted hours, leading to customer frustration; on one occasion, the establishment was closed without proper signage indicating the early closure.
- Customers have attempted to visit the restaurant multiple times and experienced issues, causing significant aggravation.
- Mention of ""mighty Quinn"" suggests either a reference to a staff member or part of a signature dish/experience at the restaurant.

Actionable Insights:

- Ensure the restaurant strictly adheres to the advertised opening hours and update any changes on all platforms (website, front door signs, social media, etc.).
- Investigate the service incident mentioned and consider training staff on proper communication and customer service etiquette, especially addressing delays with apologies and appreciation for customer patience.
- Launch an internal review to assess the authenticity of all online reviews and develop a strategy to rectify any discrepancies or consider methods to encourage genuine reviews.
- Consistency is key – work towards ensuring that the restaurant is reliable in its service to prevent further customer frustration and loss of business.
- The mention of ""mighty Quinn"" requires context for actionable insight; if it's a staff member, ensure they are aware of the customer's impression. If it's a menu item or part of an experience, consider the context of the feedback and decide if adjustments are needed."
"I came to this establishment at 11:18pm Saturday 1/14/17. There were two signs one said closed the other had the store hours (9am-4am on Saturday's) I gentleman was leaving the store and trying to unlock it from the inside, when he finally came out I asked if the store was open. He shook his head NO, and proceeded to light up a cigarette. No explanation no nothing. I think I will continue to go to the establishment in Washington heights. <|summary|> - Ensure store hours are clearly and accurately displayed to avoid customer confusion.
- Address potential issues with employees not following store hours or closing procedures correctly.
- Investigate why a staff member was at the establishment after closing hours and establish clear protocols for such situations.

- Consider additional training or reminders for staff on how to handle situations when they are leaving the store and encounter customers.
- Monitor and maintain overall professionalism at all times to ensure a positive image for the establishment.
- Acknowledge that despite this incident, the reviewer may continue patronizing the establishment, and perhaps communicate directly with them to address their experience and ensure better service in the future."
"*Delivery review* Ordered the Toro Dynasty roll via Seamless. Delivery was relatively timely, but was quite honestly disappointed in the quality of their most expensive special roll ($19). Wanted to try this place for the longest time but the toro salmon and toro tuna was lackluster and the rice was quite clumpy and hard, unlike actual sushi rice. Also charged $1 for extra ginger and gave a tiny little container. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing but given the pricing I had expected a little higher quality. Unlikely that I'll order from here again. <|summary|> - Ensure that delivery promises are not only met with punctuality but also with the expected food quality, especially for high-priced special items such as the ""Toro Dynasty"" roll.
- Investigate the quality of the ingredients such as toro salmon and toro tuna to confirm they meet your restaurant's standards for freshness and taste since they were reported to be lackluster.
- Review the preparation of sushi rice as it was criticized for being clumpy and hard, which is not characteristic of good sushi rice.
- Revisit the pricing and portion size of condiments such as extra ginger, especially if a charge is applied, to ensure customer satisfaction with the value offered.
- Consider customer expectations regarding the quality of food relative to the price point; if necessary, re-evaluate pricing or ingredient sourcing to align with those expectations.
- Take into account the feedback regarding the extra charge and container size for condiments, as this seemed to impact the customer's perception of value negatively.

Addressing these points could help improve customer satisfaction and encourage repeat business."

"Ginger Chicken is so so, and the Eggplant w. basil is disgusting. Chunk braised pork on rice really disappointed me. Vegetable Tofu soup is not for human being. lol In addition, I heard quarrels between waiters. Avoid this one, but I also heard some friends said it used to be an authentic Taiwanese restaurant. // Workers glaring, food is slow, and super pricey for a small dinner or lunch. Don't recommend coming here. I came here with my family, and the first thing I saw was a worker playing on her phone and not recognizing us. The food is okay.

- Workers' behavior, such as glaring and slow service, alongside high prices for small portions at dinner or lunch, has led to negative experiences. Immediate staff behavior corrections and review of pricing and portion sizes are required.
- One customer reported seeing a worker playing on her phone and ignoring new arrivals, which is unsatisfactory. Staff training on customer engagement and service policies should be reinforced.
- Overall food quality was considered ""okay"" and ""not bad"" by at least one patron, implying some level of baseline satisfaction with the food offerings."
"As a West Coast transplant, I have to say that I was unimpressed. Ordered the vegetarian burrito and vegetarian quesadilla. The vegetarian quesadilla had a wierd crust from being fried in too much oil and not enough veggies or cheese. // I'm so sad. Was expecting greatness, and got tacos that are so very average (which means not good). Maybe these other New Yorkers don't know what a taco should taste like. I'm from Cali, although the best taco I've ever had is from Philly (shout out don memos truck). Got a chicken, pork, and beef taco. All three were dry and lacking in flavor. Wtf yelp. <|summary|> - Investigate the preparation method for the vegetarian quesadilla to ensure it is not fried in excess oil, causing a weird crust, and consider adjusting the amount of veggies and cheese in the filling.
- Review and potentially improve the strategy for vegetarian options to make sure they come with a sufficient and satisfying amount of vegetables and cheese.

"Horribly rude people, and it's a shame as their food isn't always terrible. The orders are constantly wrong, and when we confronted them on leaving off an entire sandwich from their order, they insulted us on the phone and then hung up.

"Fuck this fucking shit hole. Been coming here for years and they don't respect the prices marked on the items they sell. They change the price at the counter and then yell at you for asking why the increase. Fuck these people. I hope they go out of business not soon enough. The husband is great, the sisters are assholes. Me and my wife have always shopped here until they became greedy bastards. Fuck them. Better delis in the hood. Too bad because the husband was cool. // They charged $5 for a 1/2 pint of milk, $6 for dozen eggs. They're greedy and miserable. I put the items back and left. Franks grill next door is amazing but this deli is ridiculous. <|summary|> Based on the given reviews, here are some actionable insights:

"We had lamb and chicken over rice. Earlier today we went to chandni, i guess our taste buds found the food pretty average... <|summary|> - Consider reviewing the lamb and chicken over rice dishes to see if there might be areas for improvement, as there was feedback suggesting these dishes were deemed average.

"I usually buy my coffee Gregory's... but I made the mistake of coming here. Guys, I don't know why you have a lot of 5-star reviews (paying relatives much?) but I agree with the 1-stars here that describe the coffee as ""liquid UNintelligence"". It's bitter, almost sour, whereas Gregory's is always on point. The space is also very cold and industrial. That's fine for a warehouse but this is a coffee place for crying out loud. Totally not my scene. Maybe others will enjoy it but it was far too crowded and loud for my liking. <|summary|> Actionable insights for improvement based on customer reviews:

- Address the taste of the coffee, as it has been described as ""bitter"" and ""almost sour,"" which suggests a problem with the coffee preparation process.
- Investigate the consistency in the quality of coffee offered compared to competitors like Gregory's, and make adjustments to meet customer expectations.

- Manage staff behavior and customer interactions to improve the restaurant's reputation, as the review reflects poorly on the establishment and could harm its standing, especially in a place like NYC where competition is fierce and reputation is crucial."
"I really like the chicken there but I am not sure of the sanitary conditions there. The man who cooks the chicken uses his bare hands to handle the chicken after wandering around the super market. I asked the man if his hands were clean. He ignored me and just pointed at the chicken telling me to go. Great experience gambling with my health. // Don't go here. Too much breading, not enough chicken. Only go to the bonchon chain restaurants in NYC. Service is slow too. // This review is solely based on 'service'. I tried to eat here after hearing a ton about bonchon from friends. But after waiting about 10 minutes to place a take out order and being completely ignored by the workers, I decided it wasn't worth it and left. <|summary|> - Improve sanitary conditions in the kitchen, especially by ensuring cooks wear gloves or wash their hands thoroughly before handling food.

"Never again. They screwed up my delivery beyond recognition - no mushrooms on my mushroom burger, cooked wrong, fountain soda when I ordered canned soda... it goes on. The worst part is that to ""make up"" for it, the owner only offered 10% off my next order, which doesn't even cover what he screwed up the first time! Aside from that, the burger was overcooked, the bun soggy, and chocolate shake=chocolate milk. <|summary|> - Address delivery issues and ensure orders are accurate and include all requested items.

"I saw the good reviews so I figured i'd give it a try. Ordered a chicken cutlet with lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers. The roasted peppers were slimy and cold, the sandwich itself came out in two mins which is a scary thing and then as I payed i see the dreaded microwave which was clearly the way my sandwich was cooked. Chicken tasted disgusting. Luckily i bought a bag of chips as well. Idk if it was a random bad experience or if this place is just this terrible usually. Never going back! <|summary|> - Address the cooking and temperature of the roasted peppers; ensure they are served hot and not slimy.

"So no comments about the food, Only the wait here is insane!!! It took them 45 min to cater to 5 people... Definitely not a Starbucks standard store.. // Cappuccino was luke warm. The barrister took his time to make it people in front of me didn't get their order and the cashiers kept chit chatting to the one customer in front while others waited to be served.

- Consider addressing these issues specifically at the mentioned location for maintaining customer satisfaction and brand reputation."
"Would not recommend anyone. All you get is frustration in evening. Happened with me twice. The timings provided in info are upto 9 pm on weekdays and up to 10 pm on weekends. On both occasions I went at 830 pm on week ends and they said they are closed. The chef was sitting outside on a break. It's completely their prerogative on when to close the shop but atleast update your timings accordingly so that customers are not mis guided. // We eat a falafel sandwich and chicken shwarma sandwich. The falafel balls were nice but the let down was the pita. The size of the sandwich was also nice.

"The only thing tougher than the ribs was the man's attitude doing the serving. I try to support my local business. Not only did I stand there waiting for service. A gentleman bringing supplies in told him I wanted to order. He was looking right at me because I was the only patron. Then he greets me with ""what?"" Not ""may I help you"" or even a ""what can I get you""..so ghetto. I understand why we don't support our own. Pitiful... // This place is horrible. Point. Blank. End of story.

WHILE WE WERE STILL IN THE STORE!!! The service was horrible, one lady was on her phone while the other made the two drinks and she didn't even ask my cousins what they wanted. The store had a sign outside that said they close at 6 30pm on Fridays yet is was 6 20 and they were kicking us out. They had people that didn't even work there inside the store which was very unprofessional and when we asked if the manager was there she said, NOPE!

"Honestly I want to give this place five stars but I don't think I will ever be patronizing this business again. As the other reviewers have said, the sandwiches are delicious and the selection can't be beat. But I've been a steady customer for about four months now and the employees have without fail been horrendously rude. So rude to the point that I weigh my desire for a sandwich with my unwillingness to be treated like garbage.

"I will write this review a million times if I have to (the last one was reported by the business), the management in this place is horrible. They don't know crap about customer service. Treated me horribly when I was there and even took my review personally by threatening to fire my friend cause i gave them bad review. The cakes are tiny, overly priced, and not worth it at all.

"Been a few months since I've been there. Went back for the mini-Tipica (that's the small version of the Bamdeja I described on my earlier review) and boy has the quality control dropped out. One half slice of maduro (fried plantain a that's 1/4 of a banana) the THINNEST slice of beef and and chicharron (pork rind) I've ever seen in my life, an unripe slice of lime... BOO!

"Just not good. Ordered French onion soup and got brown salty water with burnt onions inside. Just really no good. I wanted to like this place but... The service was bad ( no napkin, lucky the waiter gave us a spoon to use) the soup was bad. You should take that soup off your menu it's horrific! So many amazing places in the area to eat at will surely stay away from here. // Don't go there or order food from them ever. This place is just terrible, staff are mean, and they're very disrespectful to you, the place is old and stinky, food is poor and from the freezer, not the freshest. dont get ripped off.

"You know that moment when you are hungry, but want to try something new, because..well you are bored of the same-old? Yeah. So I've walked around here a few times, looked at the price, and walked out. It's so pricey. The food looks and smells good, but it's really pricey. So I went to this arepa place, because I love arepas. I decided on getting plantain con queso(?), plantain with cheese and some green sauce. Let me say, those plantains were hella burnt. The toppings added nothing to the plaintain. In short, mediocre. I may come back for the arepas, but will not order plantain here. <|summary|> - Review the pricing strategy to ensure that the costs are justifiable and provide value for money, as customers find the restaurant to be pricey.

"I started coming here on days when Esparks was too crowded. I'm slightly disappointed each time I come. The wait for a sandwich is usually ridiculously long because there is only 1 guy manning the cash register and making the food. Even an pre-made falafel from the refrigerated section took about 15 minutes to heat up. My lunch break was usually half over by the time I started eating. They make really cheesy sandwiches on their greasy grill. But it will literally take 20 minutes of awkward standing around to get your plain ham and cheese. And then you realize you're paying $6 for a sandwich and coffee when you could get a bigger, healthier sandwich with coffee for nearly 2 bucks less. The AM radio is also usually blasting staticky news if you like that sort of thing. <|summary|> - Customers experience long wait times for food due to only one person manning the cash register and preparing the food.

"Ordered the classic burger with fries last week with my coworkers and I am quite disappointed. I asked for my burger to be made medium well with no mayo or pickles but there was sauce inside the burger with pickles. My patty was well done and tasted really dry. And my fries were even more disappointing. It was soggy and tasted like it was soaked in oil. My coworkers didn't like their food either. // Disgusting burger that comes with an inflated price.

"If you go, you should be in a very laid back mood, don't expect quick service since they take their time. The food was OK, had the bistec de palomilla with rice and beans, the steak was done well with one side sort of darkened so it's caramelized. The mango shake isn't the type you would expect, it's sort of milk with mango juice.

"Food was very bland, absolutely no flavor. Small portions, and pricey. Place looks dirty. Every time I pass by its empty. This place should be investigated. // Had the rice and beans and chicken. I've had better Spanish food before, haven't returned since this meal. I thought the food lacked spices but I noticed this in most Columbian foods. I won't eat here again, I rather go around the corner to Cuzco Peruvian which is much better than this. // Prices high, food has been out all day. charged me $8 for each lunch special, when advertised at $5.50. Will never return. <|summary|> - Enhance the flavor profile of the food, as customers find it bland and lacking in taste. Consider revising recipes or ingredient quality.

"It would appear that this deli has know concept of time. When an order was placed for eggs to be picked up promptly at 9:45am on 6/29/14, upon my arrival, no eggs were to be seen. It's as though this deli exists in the space between your washing machine and your dryer; if you have them placed next to each other or stacked (this metaphor won't apply if you have a single washer / dryer unit), where time failed to maintain its steady progressions. Needless to say I never received the eggs that were promised to me, and I, as well as the 150 other people counting on these eggs, were left to eat bacon from cups. Also, this deli has no more paper plates. // These guys failed to deliver eggs on time, compromised the Krompf Improv Breakfast at the 16th annual Del Close Marathon. <|summary|> Based on the provided customer reviews, here are some actionable insights for the restaurant:

"Our go to place for ""I don't feel like cooking"" nights. Food is definitely nothing to write home about but it definitely works to get me over my craving for chinese food.

"You go there at 3:30 in the morning on a Friday and their clothes. It clearly states that are open until 4 in the morning but I guess they met their quota for the day so they leave early. You would think that they would stay open 10 minutes past their closing time but it is what it is. It's not safe in Newark and it's not worth your journey if you're coming in an hour close to closing time... // Half a mile down lake street at Tony's is 100x better. The chili here in horrible like taco meat and their onions suck. Only people who like this place are people who grew up in Newark back in the day.

"I want to like the place cuz the menu is on the creative side. But I cannot overlook the fact that they forget about me every time I order food here. The third (and final) time I tried the place, it took them 20 minutes to get me their basic egg sandwich. The reason being that they handed my sandwich to some pasty hipster chick who fit the look of clientele this place is obviously catering to.

Better Mexican food in the neighborhood. // I live about a 5 minuet walk away and my roommate and I were looking forward to giving this place a go. I had a carnitas burrito and my roommate had the chipotle chicken. I really wanted to like this place - small business, fun decor, staff was fine. The burritos just had no flavor.

"Ordered one of those hot and spicy noodle soup, there were only few tiny pieces of meat, two pieces of vegetables and bunch noodles. One of the worse place for noodle. Ingredients are not very fresh, so be careful about having diarrhea after you try. // BBQ side of has definetly gone down hill. Not what it once use to be. Poorly prepped meats ( meaning not enough marinating), poor service and now over priced. I guess this is what happens when over expansion occurs and is operated by a young staff without experience <|summary|> - Review the portion size and contents of the hot and spicy noodle soup; customers are finding the amount of meat and vegetables insufficient.
- Assess and ensure freshness of ingredients in noodle dishes to prevent potential health issues such as diarrhea.

"Saturday, 9pm. Place is busy! The whole atmosphere on the Beach 96 feels like a full time vacation, Rockaways become better every year! Regardless the long line bartender was serving people cutting the line (and she saw that) which I think is unethical. and the second thing is their SANGRIA. I mean wtf who decided to call it a sangria?!! It tastes like yuppi mixed with cheapest alcohol and they charge $8 for that! I will certainly come again for good vibes and music and atmosphere. Byob however <|summary|> - Address the issue of the bartender serving people who are cutting the line, as customers find it unethical.
- Review the pricing and quality of the Sangria, as there's a complaint about it tasting like cheap alcohol despite an $8 charge.

"Super average food. I've had much better bandeja paisas elsewhere, especially for the price they charge for the mini size. The arepas were forgotten with our paisas, but when they came out they were extremely stale. The empanadas were nice though, and very fresh. Maracuya was average, and the service was subpar. Much better Colombian spots in the area, especially for what they charge here! // I had a bad experience at this place. I walked in and the woman there made fun of me for looking Indian. I told her that I was Colombian and that it shouldn't matter if I was from India. She kept making fun of my looks. It was unpleasant and sadly she didn't seem to realize that in a service business it is not acceptable to make fun of the customers' looks. <|summary|> Here are the actionable insights based on the customer reviews:

- Improve the overall quality of the food offered, as customers find the current offerings to be ""super average"" and not a good value for the price.
- Enhance the freshness of arepas, as there were complaints about them being ""extremely stale"" when they were served.

Remember to address these issues promptly to improve the overall customer experience and to avoid the chance of losing customers to the competition."
"I didn't eat here but feel compelled to write a 1 star review anyway. I tried. Trust me. I placed an order for delivery and even though I live a half mile away they wanted to charge a $3 delivery fee. They said its the bosses rules. Fuck the boss. I cancelled my order because of that. // Poor service, expensive food were the two major turn offs. The food quality... I think it's unfair for my to say it's bad because I imagine it's very authentic with a strong halal smell and taste. Just wasn't my style of super americanized chicken and rice that I've come to love from Halal Guys or Juicy Platters. <|summary|> - Investigate possible unjustified delivery fee charges, especially for nearby customers, and adapt the delivery policy if necessary.
- Address the complaint about poor service to improve customer satisfaction.
- Review food pricing to ensure it matches customer expectations of value.

- Investigate competitors like Halal Guys or Juicy Platters to understand customers' benchmarks for Americanized dishes and possibly adjust offerings."
"I've tried so hard to give this place the benefit of the doubt but I can't! Prices are Ridiculously high for the quality of food. I rather spend $15 in a high end Manhattan restaurant than here! The croutons taste like pure grease and the salads are mediocre. The pizza and wings are even worse. I ordered wings and they were totally fried with hot sauce on the side!! Hello that isn't Buffalo wings! Don't get me started on their soup! Salty, watery and nasty! This place is awful! Food, quality and price are a rip off! FYI! I've been here at least 3 times trying not to judge! But come on!!! // Eww gross. Shitty pizza made by Mexicans. Nasty cheese , sauce is weak. Will never try it again. 5 stars you guys are nuts! <|summary|> - Reviewers are indicating that the prices are very high when compared to the quality of the food.
- There are specific complaints about the taste and preparation of certain dishes such as croutons (described as ""pure grease"") and salads (described as ""mediocre"").

- The soup has been described unfavorably as ""salty, watery and nasty.""
- Customers feel that they are being ripped off, stating that the combination of food quality and price is not acceptable.
- These insights suggest that the owner should reassess pricing strategy, improve food preparation and recipes, particularly for the mentioned dishes, and correctly label menu items to set the right expectations.
- The cultural authenticity of the cuisine might be a concern, as indicated by the negative comment about ""Mexican-made"" pizza. Staff training or hiring staff with specific cuisine expertise could be considered.
- Overall dissatisfaction from repeated visits suggests that improvement in food quality is needed as it's a recurring issue and not a one-time experience."
"I guess it got a bit better since before Sandy. But I still think there's too much of everything. Place looks clattered with products. Cold cuts aren't the best, hyland blvd place has better food, plus better and more polite service. And for the owner stay out. You make it look worse, either run the place and do everything or hire the right people. <|summary|> - Consider decluttering the restaurant space as customers find it cluttered with products.
- Improve the quality of cold cuts, as current offerings are seen as inferior to a competitor on Hyland Blvd.
- Address the comments on politeness and quality of service as a competitor is noted to have better service.

- The owner's presence in the restaurant might be perceived negatively; focus on operations or customer relations may be required or consider hiring the right management to improve the establishment's reputation."
"i never get lunch here. in fact, i never get anything edible here. it only comes in handy for a beverage to keep my thirst quenched. a myriad of better lunch options await. // Food is overpriced, and some of it is borderline inedible. A lot of options, but the place is often overcrowded and disorganized around lunch time. Many better options nearby. // Come here after class to grab a bite. A little pricey but they have the cutest little mini salads! They are scrumptious! And great soup too. People that work there... A little loud and atittude-y at times. <|summary|> - Improve lunch offerings: Customers find the current options unappetizing and are choosing other venues for better lunch alternatives.
- Review pricing strategy: Feedback indicates that the menu items are overpriced, particularly given the quality.
- Address edibility of food: Some dishes are considered barely edible, which is a concern that demands immediate menu assessment and potential recipe adjustments.

Taking action on these points may help in improving customer satisfaction and potentially increase repeat business."
"Pretty meh. I'm obsessed with French things so figured i'd check it out. On the early side of when it opened, so maybe things are better but I wasn't too impressed. It's trying to be a mix of sports bar and French wine bar I think, but it doesn't really work. Wine was fantastic, can't knock it for that. Service was ok. Got some food, including a meat/cheese plate. They had run out of a lot of things, had to keep repeating our order, and when it came out, it was a huge board with very minimal food on it for $18. Would much rather go to Matisse, La Cava, or Sofia wine bar, sorry. <|summary|> Here's a summary of the actionable insights from the provided customer reviews:

- The concept of the restaurant may not be clearly defined; consider revising or better integrating the themes of sports bar and French wine bar.
- The wine selection is appreciated, indicating that maintaining or enhancing this aspect could be beneficial.
- Service was deemed acceptable, but not outstanding; there is room for improvement in service quality.
- Food availability issues were noted (running out of menu items), suggesting better inventory management or menu adjustments might be necessary.
- The presentation of a meat/cheese plate was disappointing in terms of value for the price; reviewing portion sizes or pricing to ensure customer satisfaction is recommended.
- Customers may not perceive the restaurant as competitive with other local wine bars; gather intel on local competitors and identify areas where the restaurant can differentiate or improve.

Following these insights could help address the concerns and improve the overall customer experience."
"I hate not to love this place because 1. the staff and owners are so warm and friendly 2. the restaurant is so bright and clean and 3. the portions are large with reasonable prices. But the food did not make up for it. I am not Thai but I eat Thai food at least once a week and my college roommate of four years is Thai so I know what their dishes are suppose to taste like. Do not expect authentic Thai food here. They may have tweaked the flavors to accommodate everyone's taste buds. Huge lack of spice and a little too heavy on the sugar. <|summary|> - The staff and owners are warm and friendly.
- The restaurant is bright and clean.
- Portions are large with reasonable prices.
- The food quality does not meet expectations for authentic Thai cuisine.
- The flavors might be too adapted to a generic palate, lacking in spice and potentially excessive in sugar."

"Good food but the service truly sucks. They advertise free orange juice with the brunch menu but don't give it to you unless you ask for it. // walk in on a sunday,,not crowded,asked for a hot ham and cheese on a coussiant,and a bacon and eggs on a roll with butter,, to go what we actually got was cold ham and cheese on a roll,bacon and eggs with cheese...ruined our sunday morning breakfast,, <|summary|> - Improve service quality as there are currently customer complaints about poor service.

"The food was edible but it is in NO WAY BBQ. I ordered a ""rack of ribs"" for $19 and they were heated on the grill and there were no ribs, just meat...wtf? It looks like everything is just taken from a freezer and ""prepared"". If I didnt have a 1/2 off coupon there is no way Id have paid for the food when I went to pick it up <|summary|> - Address customer dissatisfaction with the BBQ category, as the food did not meet expectations for a BBQ dish.
- Investigate the presentation of the ""rack of ribs"" order as it was not as advertised (lacked ribs, appeared to be just meat).

"It's a typical Staten Island bar, with average prices for drinks. The atmosphere was not what I expected, it was too loud and rowdy, and the night that I was here, a fight broke out. It was pretty boring here. Aside from the televisions, there was a music box that you can pay to have songs played, and the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting.

"The food tastes awful and it is way overpriced. The owner is also a little rude. I had a coworker that went there every day for breakfast and at the end of the week, he was told that he had not paid all week for his food and now he had owed about $50. I have never seen anything like this. It also smells awful in there. Do not eat the chicken salad, i took one bite and threw it in the garbage. I decided to give it another truly and got a hamburger made of rotted, old meat. Disgusting! // Overpriced. Paid $7 for a small chicken salad sandwich that came with nothing but an under brined pickle. <|summary|> - Address the quality of food, as customers have complained about the taste and freshness (describing it as awful and comparing it to rotten, old meat).
- Reevaluate the pricing strategy since customers feel it is overly expensive for the quality and portion size provided.

"I think this place is under new ownership than what Tom Z. commented on. The sign outside no longer says ""Gada's"" and I've never seen a woman in the place. I may be wrong but that's what I strongly suspect. Ordered a turkey club - turkey was good, sandwich as a whole was ehh. Something just tasted a bit off, bacon seemed precooked days before, lettuce and tomato didn't look or taste fresh. Mayo was off... Took one bite and threw it out. Never again. <|summary|> - Investigate potential changes in ownership and update restaurant branding as necessary, including signage that still references the previous owner's establishment ""Gada's.""
- Address customer perceptions that there may be no female presence in management or staff, considering ways to diversify or highlight diversity.
- Review the quality and preparation methods of the turkey club sandwich ingredients (i.e., turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo) as there were complaints about taste.

"This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. The hostess/waitress was super nasty, lazy and rude. She was inattentive, cold and made the experience horrible. The food was ok (after waiting for almost an hour for dinner- anything seems to satisfy me). But the food was nothing amazing tbh. I've had better Turkish food elsewhere with better hospitality. NEVER coming back here. // Horrible customer service I've ever encountered in Astoria! The waiter was super condescending and rude. We waited two hours for our food and they even got our order wrong. Then they try to compensate us with a free house salad, which was ridiculous! Never again will I go back to this place or recommend anyone to go there! Tons of better places for middle eastern food and hookah around that area! <|summary|> Based on the provided customer reviews, here are the actionable insights for improvement:

- Address staff behavior: Numerous complaints regarding the hostess and waitstaff being rude, inattentive, and condescending.
- Improve wait times: Both reviews mention excessively long waits for food—up to an hour in one case and two hours in another.
- Correct order accuracy: In the second review, there was a complaint about receiving the wrong order, suggesting issues with order accuracy.
- Improve compensation strategies: Attempting to compensate diners with a free salad was seen as inadequate especially after such negative experiences.
- Consider an overhaul of hospitality training: Both reviews suggest the staff's attitude and service were significantly below expectations and a revamp of customer service standards may be necessary.
- Evaluate and enhance the quality of the food: While food quality was not the main issue, one reviewer mentioned it was just ""ok"" and not ""amazing,"" indicating there could be room for improvement.
  
It's imperative to address these issues promptly to improve future customer experiences and the restaurant's reputation."
"I was really excited when this place opened up, but really disappointed with the sushi. The rolls were mostly rice, and they were falling apart. On one side of the roll it was seaweed paper and the other a ball of rice. There was hardly any fish in the rolls. It was almost as if the person making the rolls had never done it before. I really wanted to see this place succeed, and I hope you take my criticism with stride. I would love to turn this review into 5 stars. I would recommend hiring a good sushi chef. // Very small portions and average food for such expensive prices. I'm a petite female so I don't eat much; but this was so underwhelming/disappointing. Should've spent $ elsewhere. <|summary|> - Improve sushi roll quality by:
  - Ensuring better balance of rice and other ingredients.
  - Focusing on the rolls' structural integrity to prevent them from falling apart.
  - Increasing the amount of fish in the sushi rolls.

"Tried this place at Bryant Park today to check out what the hype was all about. I got the 2 baos (pork belly + peking duck) with popcorn chicken combo for $13.06 with tax included...portion was just right. However, the baos were just ok...nothing special. Like another reviewer mentioned, you can definitely get better baos for much cheaper elsewhere. As for the popcorn chicken, it was wayyy too salty...it was as if I was eating salt!! The chicken would've been amazing if it wasn't so salty =( <|summary|> - Review the pricing and portion sizes to ensure customers feel they are getting good value (referencing the baos and their price).
- Consider evaluating and potentially improving the quality of the baos, as the customer found them to be just okay and mentioned that better options are available at lower prices elsewhere.
- Address the excessive saltiness of the popcorn chicken to ensure it meets customer taste preferences.
- Investigate potential recipe adjustments for the popcorn chicken to balance the salt content."
"This review is based solely on Seamless orders. The Seamless estimate was 45-60 minutes. 65 minutes later I call in and the delivery guy had just left. Got the food 80 minutes later. I suggest you not order from this place if you are in a rush until they get their act together. However, the kimbobs were pretty good. I had the beef and chicken and they were both tasty. Not as good as the ones you can get in Flushing but good for a place on Manhattan. // I would have ordered food from them but then found that they stick their cards on Citibike's baskets... Now I will never patronize them. <|summary|> - Review your Seamlesss order delivery time estimates to ensure they are accurate and deliveries are on time, as there was a complaint about an order being delivered 80 minutes later than the estimated 45-60 minutes.
- Consider implementing an improved system for handling delivery delays and communicate proactively with customers when there is an expected delay.
- Based on the positive feedback on the taste of the kimchi rice with beef and chicken, maintain the quality of these dishes as they seem to be well-received, despite not being as good as the ones in Flushing, but appreciated for Manhattan standards.
- Address the issue of employees placing business cards on Citi Bike's baskets as a form of advertisement, as it has caused at least one customer to decide against patronizing the restaurant again."
"Ordered through GrubHub, said my food would be delivered between 1:35-1:45. It's almost 2 p.m. AND the guy who answered the phone had the audacity to hang up on me.

- Consider following up with the particular customer who had a negative experience to offer an apology and possibly compensation to mitigate the damage done to the restaurant's reputation.
- Review policies with third-party delivery partners like GrubHub to ensure they align with the restaurant's standards for customer service and delivery performance."
"We went there around 11:00PM. The service is very slow. We did not see a waiter for a long time. I still had to go get the waiter ran downstairs. Fatty lamb skewers, cold noodles tasted blander. No one initiative to add water. I'd never go there again! <|summary|> - Improve service speed, especially during late evening times, as there was a significant wait reported around 11:00 PM.
- Ensure that waiters are more attentive and available to guests to avoid customers having to search for them.
- Address the food quality issues: the lamb skewers were found fatty and the noodles were cold and bland.
- Proactive service needs improvement; staff should offer to refill water without being asked.
- Create a strategy to prevent customers from having such negative experiences that they would not consider returning."
"Over priced and the food tasted microwaved. I ordered a chicken platter and was very disappointed. Bland, rubbery and all the other signs of being microwaved. <|summary|> - Review your pricing strategy to ensure that customers feel they are getting value for their money.
- Assess the quality of the food, particularly the chicken platter, to ensure it does not appear or taste like it's been microwaved.
- Address the taste profile of your dishes to avoid them being perceived as bland or rubbery.
- Investigate the cooking methods to prevent any indication that the food is being microwaved, which is often associated with lower-quality cuisine."
"Food is good and the place is clean. Customer service isn't worth the hassle at all. // this place sucks!! overpriced and gave me the wrong order. terrible // I have been here many times. Often times order is wrong, I always feel rushed on the phone and even feel like I'm being scolded sometimes. Rude service.

"Typical Chinese restaurant. The restaurant itself is old so I recommend taking your food to go or having it delivered. // I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and in the middle of eating I found a HUGE FLY in my food. How pissed would you be. Don't buy your food here. It's disgusting. <|summary|> - Consider revamping or updating the restaurant's interior as it is perceived as old.

- Monitor food preparations closely, especially dishes involving seafood, to prevent any similar incidents.
- Implement a quality control process to catch any problems before food reaches the customer."
"We ordered the Imperial Bing (which is the Peking duck one). You can choose soft vs. crispy and we ordered it crispy, but either they gave us the soft version or the crispy is not remotely crispy... Not very much duck inside and what little there was was mostly skin and fat... there was one part where I could still see some feathery nubs or something so that freaked me out. I definitely understand that Peking duck generally does have lots of skin and fat and is somewhat expensive, but I would rather have paid twice as much and gotten some of the good, meaty parts than what we had. I liked the apple and cucumber slaw part. As an aside, I think it's funny / sad that they have to use French / Spanish words of ""crepe"" and ""burrito"" to describe it. <|summary|> - Ensure that when customers order dishes like the Imperial Bing (Peking duck), they receive the version that they requested (soft vs. crispy). If a crispy version is ordered, it should be adequately crispy.
- The portion size and ratio of meat to fat and skin in the Peking duck dish might need to be evaluated to ensure it meets customers' expectations.
- Look into a quality control issue where a customer found feather stubs, which can be off-putting and should be removed thoroughly.
- Review pricing to ensure value matches customer expectations, particularly for dishes known to have higher price points like Peking duck.
- Maintain the quality of side dishes such as the apple and cucumber slaw, which received a positive mention.
- Consider the cultural sensitivity or appropriateness of using words from other languages in the menu descriptions, as it was noted but with a mixed reaction from the customer."
"This place is absolutely CHAOTIC because they have such few tables in such a small place, the waiters and waitresses are immensely rude, the food overly salty and mediocre for Turkish food, but the reason that got me to stop going here was the fact that I found a long piece of hair (certainly not my own as it was red) in my bulgar TWICE. Absolutely disgusting. <|summary|> - Improve space management by possibly rearranging or reducing the number of tables to address the chaotic atmosphere due to limited space.
- Address staff behavior by providing customer service training to ensure waiters and waitresses are polite and professional.
- Review the seasoning in dishes, specifically regarding the salt levels, to improve the quality of the food.
- Examine and enhance the Turkish food offerings to better meet customer expectations and stand out from competitors.
- Implement strict hygiene controls, including thorough checks of dishes before they are served to prevent incidents like the hair found in the food, which was especially concerning as it happened more than once."
"Sorry but this place lost it all. Used to be an excellent pizzaria in the 80's // Regular pie was average at best. Service was very good but probably won't return. <|summary|> - The restaurant used to be an excellent pizzeria in the 1980s.
- The quality of the regular pizza has declined and is now considered average at best.
- The service quality remains very good.
- Despite the good service, the customer is unlikely to return due to the food quality."
"This food absolutely did not meet my expectations as far as the other reviews go. If you like Mexican food or any type of food at that I would not recommend it. The people are ok but the food is just disappointing. // The food tasted really good fast service good prices... BUT I got an E. Coli infection from the ground beef tacos. I guess they didnt clean the meat properly with lemon juice . <|summary|> - Address customer dissatisfaction with food not meeting expectations.

"I had such high hopes. It's close to the office, looked clean, etc. Then I tasted the food. I rarely leave a gyro on a plate but this needs serious improvement. I LOVE gyros...but I won't be returning. <|summary|> Here are the summarized actionable insights from the provided customer reviews:

- Maintain the restaurant's cleanliness as it is appreciated (mentions it looked clean).
- Address the quality of the gyro specifically, as the customer had high expectations but was let down (mentions needing serious improvement and having high hopes).
- Review the preparation and recipe for the gyro to ensure it meets customer expectations, as this customer, who claims to love gyros, left it uneaten.
- Encourage staff to ask for feedback, especially from customers who leave food uneaten, to improve and prevent similar issues.

I was told that I must come in to do so. I arrived at the establishment at apx 740 when I was told rudely that I may only order Fried foods.

"The food is great here. The only thing is the unethical practice of the cashiers charging different prices on the same items ordered everyday. These cashiers are not new to the joint. They were there when the business was under a different name. One day an egg sandwich on sliced bread is 2.99, the other day its 4.08 .

"I've been to D'Antigua twice to see cumbia villera bands and I was not impressed. Aside from the band, there was really nothing else about this place that was interesting. It has an odd ""dive bar"" feel with a dance floor in the middle and a stage (?). It's very dark inside and the DJs I've seen there aren't very good. There are so many other lounges/clubs on Northern Boulevard and I'd say it's safe to pass this one up for something else. <|summary|> - Consider improving the quality or variety of entertainment, as the customer was unimpressed with the bands and DJs at D'Antigua.

"This place is just okay, nothing special, nothing outstanding. Their specialty is supposed to be the Rotisserie chicken and although it's inexpensive, it is ridiculously over-salted, almost inedible. And the green Peruvian Aji Sauce is very bland and flavorless. If you want real Peruvian Rotisserie chicken and a dynamite sauce, go to Pio Pio in Queens. There is no comparison. And they are CASH only, nothing online, minimalist setup, not worth it unless you're really, really hungry.

"Dude.. this place used to be my go-to spot for sashimi platters. They used to be the bzomb. Don't know if management changed (again) or if they just lost all motivation in life. Quality n quantity have gone down the crapper. Fish was stank, sides were meager, n waitstaff (many of them the same folks from years back) seemed depressed n apathetic.

"Very very rude people. I don't know who that lady is at the front counter, but my experiences with her have never been pleasant. Today November 28, 2016 is the last of my money they will ever receive. // The sushi was underwhelming. It was probably a tad lower than mediocre. I was hoping for a sushi restaurant to blow me away in the area. But this is not it. It's been my experience when sushi is delivered on a wooden boat to your table, it is usually not good.

"Overpriced and stuffy, with a pretentious inexperienced, unfriendly cold management apparently not well schooled in Hospitality Sciences Food is meh and deja vu countless times, with overwhelming visual clumsy presentation lacking culinary artistry. Also they pre charge in advance with gratuites when you make a reservation, but from reliable info don't actually pay their service personnel with tips but rather hourly low wages rate (quite a scheme ) ???

"This place is trash ....the way they run business, i've seen gangs with more structure and organization. The business owner won't take responsibility for his business when there's a problem, and his employees are just a bunch of lying, hoodrats.... like no joke... trashy... The only good thing about this place is their cheap food when you're broke as hell and that's it! Count your money before you leave, count the quantity of your food items before buyng and handing them your money, because they will tell you it's your fault at the end of all their mess.

"I really wanted to like this place. Friend texted me on a Saturday morning because she was craving crepes, so we decided to check out Crepe Sucre. I ordered the La Complete (egg, ham, gruyere cheese). It was completely dry and barely had any ham in it. When I cut each piece, it was just some dry cheese sandwiched between the crepe layers. Friend's sweet Crepe (strawberry, banana, Nutella, almonds) was better, but nothing that particularly wowed me. <|summary|> - Review the preparation of the ""La Complete"" crepe, specifically regarding its moisture content and filling amount (particularly ham).

"Brunch party - not child friendly. Accidentally ended here looking for brunch with the family and they had a brunch party with live DJ. Place seems great but not for families with children. // Our group made a reservation for lunch months ahead of time. When we arrived, the staff was courteous, but barely there. From the time that we entered to the time that we got our entrees was over two hours - at least one of these hours passed after orders were put in. We won't be back. // Had the skirt steak and salad....let's say I could have done a better job. Was not impressed, if I go back it will be to have a few drinks at the bar which seemed to be serving some good drinks. <|summary|> After analyzing the separate customer reviews, here are the action points I have distilled:

- Evaluate the restaurant's marketing and environment to ensure that it is accurately portrayed as either child-friendly or not. The current brunch party atmosphere with a live DJ may not be suitable for families with children.
  
- Review and improve the reservation handling and overall customer service. Customers who have made reservations should not be made to feel neglected, and staff presence should be consistent.

- Address the timeliness of food service as there are complaints about over two hours of wait time from entrance to receiving entrees. This might involve streamlining kitchen operations or better managing customer expectations.

- Assess and possibly enhance the quality of the dishes served. Feedback for items like the skirt steak and salad was negative, with a suggestion that even customers felt they could do a better job.

- Consider focusing on strengths, such as the bar area which has received positive notes about its drinks. This could potentially become a unique selling point for the establishment. 

These insights should be incorporated into management strategies to improve the overall customer experience."
"I know writing a yelp review of a bodega makes me a total douchebag, but I'm sorry I just have to. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I have gotten a sandwich here they have messed it up. When I ask for hot peppers, I'll get sweet peppers or no peppers; cheese when I ask for no cheese. No matter who is making the sandwich it is ALWAYS wrong. They find a way to make a mistake on even the simplest sandwich. It's truly inexplicable.

"Located right behind the Q58 bus stop. It's one of the cheapest places in this whole area. Sometimes the staff is like Russian roulette. You'll never know when the counter person is going to be rude or helpful. If you speak only English, be prepared for some amount of miscommunication. One lady was particularly nasty, and threw in something I didn't really ask for. Otherwise I would've given this place more stars. However, as I've mentioned before, this place is super cheap. I had a zongzi from here once, and it was really tasty. Sometimes I get the fried Scallion Doughnut. Good for when you're low on cash and in a hurry. <|summary|> - The restaurant is located right behind the Q58 bus stop and is one of the cheapest options in the area.

"Last summer and a few before that, this place was legit. We just got a couple sandwiches today, first day of the Smorg and they were inedible. Pulled meat and coldcuts have replaced their old menu items featuring whole pieces of meat. The braised pork looked like tuna fish, tasted like it too. The cheap slab of ham from costco for particularly gross. Even the pancake wasnt as good as it was. Sorry OB, you used to be really really good but now, this is nothing more then a cheap deli sandwich. <|summary|> - Consider revisiting the recent menu changes, specifically the replacement of whole pieces of meat with cold cuts and pulled meat which have received negative feedback.
- The quality of the new meats, such as the braised pork that resembled tuna fish in appearance and taste, needs to be evaluated and possibly improved.
- Assess the supplier for the ham used in the sandwiches as it was described as particularly gross, hinting at an issue with the quality or type of ham currently being used.
- Re-examine the pancake recipe or preparation method as the quality seems to have declined from previous standards.
- Overall, address the shift in perceived value and quality of the food offerings from what was once regarded as really good to now being equated to a cheap deli sandwich experience.

Based on the feedback, it is important to ensure that quality is not compromised with any new menu changes and that classic offerings maintain their reputation."
"Maybe dining in is highly reviewed, but do NOT deal with delivery. They quoted me a 850-9pm on a 8:21pm order time stamp.....delivery came @ 9:39pm my food arrived soggy. Keep in mind this is 8-block WALK up 8th ave.....so why quote a delivery window so inaccurate?

"I was in this place 3 times, after 1st I would not come back, but I was invited to attend party .I have number of issues. 1. Twice when we ordered lamb shish kebab, they serve pork and lamb, I prepare lamb shish kebeb at home, and know how meat should look, lamb never is light (it is red meat, and turn dark whet it is well done, or stays red for medium) 2. My husband had lamb chabs twice within a month and portion 2nd time was a lot smaller. I would not come back <|summary|> - Problem with meat orders: There have been instances where lamb shish kebabs were ordered, but pork was served alongside the lamb. The customer has experience with preparing lamb shish kebabs at home and noticed the lamb served at the restaurant does not appear as typical lamb meat should (lamb meat should be red and turn dark when well-done or stay red for medium).
  
- Issue with consistency in serving size: The customer's husband received lamb chops twice in a span of a month, and the second portion was significantly smaller than the first.

Based on these points, here are some actions you might consider:

- Review the sourcing and preparation methods for lamb dishes to ensure that only the specified meats are served as per the menu's promises. Mislabeling or mistakenly serving the wrong kind of meat is a serious error that should be corrected immediately.
  
- Investigate potential problems in the kitchen or supply chain that could lead to inconsistencies in portion size. Staff should be trained or reminded about the portion sizes to ensure consistency for every customer.

- Evaluate staff knowledge and training, specifically regarding meat identification and handling, to prevent future mistakes in serving incorrect meats.

- Consider implementing a quality control system to maintain consistency in serving sizes and food quality.

- Reach out to the customer to apologize and offer a solution or compensation to address their poor experience.

- Ensure that all customer feedback is reviewed regularly to identify and rectify recurring issues."
"This place is decent.. just ok.. not ALL that.. no way.. they always push things that will expire soon... IT is just the Italian scene is going the way of the dinosaur in that part of Brooklyn so people hang on to the old days... I never get much when in there.. not a big store... some people gripe about it.. I hear it... Is it good to have? Yes.. but are there better? I don't know anymore IN Brooklyn... I don't hate the place but do not see the WOW factor here.... // No deli slicer. All packaged meats. Walk in and the place smells awful. Same owner of A.L.C Italian Grocery, which is a much better Italian Grocery store. Go there. <|summary|> - Improve strategy to not push products nearing expiration.
- Consider revitalizing the Italian scene in the area to stay relevant.
- Update store offerings as customers perceive the selection to be limited.
- Address customer complaints about the smell inside the store.
- Evaluate the use of pre-packaged meats instead of a deli slicer, which might be affecting perceived freshness and quality.
- Look into reasons why the place may lack a ""WOW"" factor for customers.
- Take inspiration from or collaborate with A.L.C. Italian Grocery, mentioned as a better Italian grocery store, to improve store attractiveness."
"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM HERE. This place is ridiculous when delivering and it wasn't just the first time. Two times I've ordered delivery and it was and hour and a half at least the first time and over TWO hours the second time. We called an hour after waiting and they hadn't even started our food yet. The only reason I give it two stars and not one is that the food is not terrible. It's not amazing, but it can hit the spot. However I will never order delivery from this place again. <|summary|> - Evaluate and improve the restaurant's delivery service due to multiple complaints about excessive delivery times, with reports of over an hour and a half on one occasion and over two hours on another.
- Ensure the restaurant starts preparing food promptly after an order is received, as there's feedback indicating that food preparation hadn't begun even an hour after ordering.
- Maintain food quality standards as the customer finds the food acceptable, noting that, although it's not amazing, it does match expectations at times (""it can hit the spot"").
- Address issues with delivery promptly when customers call to inquire, providing accurate updates and apologies for delays to improve customer service.
- Consider implementing a system to track and manage delivery times to prevent future negative experiences and to stay competitive with other delivery services.
- Despite the food quality being considered decent, prioritize addressing delivery service shortcomings as they are significant enough to deter customers from repeat business."
"Go Noodles? More like No Noodles. We ordered the Mei Fun chicken noodles, wanton soup, and the lo mien. All of it was generally bland and without much flavor. This is nothing more than your cookie cutter Chinese place. There's a million more of them and you can probably find a better one for a similar price. To top it off, the fortune cookie was just a Yoda quote. ""Do or do not. There is no try."" I know that's not their fault, but it was an amusingly bad ending to the meal. <|summary|> - Improve the flavor profile of dishes such as Mei Fun chicken noodles, wonton soup, and lo mein, as customers have found them to be generally bland and lacking flavor.
- Differentiate your restaurant from ""cookie-cutter"" Chinese places by offering unique or higher quality dishes to avoid being directly compared to the multitude of similar restaurants.
- Rethink the message or concept behind fortune cookies to enhance the dining experience and avoid coming across as trite or irrelevant."
