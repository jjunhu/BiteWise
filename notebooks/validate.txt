"<comments> Our go to place for ""I don't feel like cooking"" nights. Food is definitely nothing to write home about but it definitely works to get me over my craving for chinese food. The soup is just OK, not crazy about the wontons. Chicken and broccoli is just the same as every other place. I will order again but its not a place I'd really recommend unless you're lazy and don't feel like cooking. <summary> Based on the reviews provided, here are the actionable insights for the restaurant:

- Market the restaurant as a go-to option for customers who do not feel like cooking at home, particularly on nights they are craving Chinese food.

Don't waste your time and money! // I work in Newark as an EMT covering 911 calls. I had gone into Las Canastillas to order some pupusas and waited as long as I could. At this point I had waited approximately 10 minutes before I had an assignment. The staff was nasty because I had to leave telling me that it's going to be 10 more minutes.

"<comments> Not a Fan. We went here for coffee in the morning and were very disappointed. I ordered a carmel latte and was very surprised when they pulled out a bottle of coffee maid creamer instead of using carmel syrup. The coffee was then in turn room temp because they added A LOT of the cold creamer to it.

We came here because all the other restaurants around were PACKED, and this place was super empty, which in retrospect should have warned us away... Anyway, we were only able to get our appetizer because after waiting an hour, they still couldn't find a way to bring us our entrees.

"<comments> As a West Coast transplant, I have to say that I was unimpressed. Ordered the vegetarian burrito and vegetarian quesadilla. The vegetarian quesadilla had a wierd crust from being fried in too much oil and not enough veggies or cheese. // I'm so sad. Was expecting greatness, and got tacos that are so very average (which means not good). Maybe these other New Yorkers don't know what a taco should taste like. I'm from Cali, although the best taco I've ever had is from Philly (shout out don memos truck). Got a chicken, pork, and beef taco. All three were dry and lacking in flavor.

"<comments> Located right behind the Q58 bus stop. It's one of the cheapest places in this whole area. Sometimes the staff is like Russian roulette. You'll never know when the counter person is going to be rude or helpful. If you speak only English, be prepared for some amount of miscommunication. One lady was particularly nasty, and threw in something I didn't really ask for. Otherwise I would've given this place more stars. However, as I've mentioned before, this place is super cheap. I had a zongzi from here once, and it was really tasty. Sometimes I get the fried Scallion Doughnut.

There were 4 of the cafe employees sprawled out over the chairs for passengers doing everything but working. The one lady behind the counter told me she did not have any coffee and dismissed me. Not satisfied with her answer, I asked the lazy employees gossiping on the chairs behind me how it was possible that they did not have any coffee.

"<comments> I got delivery from here and it was quite bad. Even most of the expensive rolls were tasteless. The fish was not super-fresh, and the scallop was so shady that I threw it out after tasting. Bad, not fresh, and over-priced = big no. The vanilla mochi were okay, though they were a bit hard to eat. // Went here because it was a little cheaper than other places. Won't make that mistake again. The sushi quality is pretty bad. Doesn't seem fresh at all. The tuna was FULL of Sinew (the white stringy/chewy tissue) which if you anything about sushi, you know it's the worst/cheapest/least fresh cut.

Will never return! // Always used to be a lovely place to go, but as of Jan 2014 they have started insisting aggressively on their members-only policy. Doorman at the front, ""El Delgado"", was extremely rude.... the previous time, back in September, they had been falling over themselves to encourage us to join and sign our son up for music classes.

"<comments> Why so rude and surly, morning crew? My experience here couldn't have been farther from a bisou (kiss in French). Also they must use sweetened almond milk for their coffee because it was almost undrinkable once I added my usual tiny bit of sugar, though it was a good size and decently priced if you're not discriminating about the quality of the drink. Counting down the days until Bittersweet reopens. (Also very confused by the wannabe sexy lounge vibe. Is this part of the Smooch rebranding? It's not working.) <summary> - Address morning staff demeanor; customers find them rude and surly.

"<comments> I had eaten at this truck when it was called NYC Cravings, which was a strangely non-descriptive name. I found the meat to be bland, and the rice to be dry. They were also at the Vendys, and it struck me the same way. Very disappointing. But now that they've shed the Cravings tag and anointed themselves Bian Dang, I'd give them another shot. Add in the factor that they were doing a lunch special deal today, I headed over despite the rainy weather. Sold out. At a little after 1 PM. They reached a new level of disappointment. Here's a tip: If you want to rehabilitate your image through a special, you better put our mouths where your money is. <summary> - Improve food seasoning and moisture to avoid descriptions of ""meat to be bland"" and ""rice to be dry.""
- Consistency in quality should be maintained across different locations, such as the NYC Cravings truck and the Vendys, to prevent customer disappointment.

The bbq chicken was serviceable. The sides were devoid of seasonings or real flavor. The mac and cheese was mushy to the point of being more of a pudding consistency. It tasted like mush and cheese. Very disappointing. Where was the milk, eggs, salt, pepper? Something? Anything? Then there were the greens (sigh). The only thing I tasted was the tang of vinegar.

We sat at our table for another 20 mins, in which time no one else came and talked to us or took our order. The tap water was also never delivered. After we sat down, two new tables were served water, bread and waiter came over and took their drinks orders.

"<comments> It would appear that this deli has know concept of time. When an order was placed for eggs to be picked up promptly at 9:45am on 6/29/14, upon my arrival, no eggs were to be seen. It's as though this deli exists in the space between your washing machine and your dryer; if you have them placed next to each other or stacked (this metaphor won't apply if you have a single washer / dryer unit), where time failed to maintain its steady progressions. Needless to say I never received the eggs that were promised to me, and I, as well as the 150 other people counting on these eggs, were left to eat bacon from cups.

"<comments> This is by far the blandest pad Thai I have ever had in my life. It tastes like nothing // Wasn't good at all. Pad Thai was a congealed lump, tom yum soup was made from a stock cube, green chicken curry was actually grey (how did they do that?). Better Thai places in the neighborhood for sure. Only redeemable feature was that the delivery guy was friendly (one star for him). I feel bad that he has to deliver such awful food. I'm all for supporting neighborhood joints, and I hope they turn it around. But they won't be round long if they keep serving that up for their customers.

"<comments> Hurry & Tasty thrives on its delivery service as most of its patrons are recipients of their incredibly slow delivery people. Having ordered twice, each had me waiting over an hour to where I didn't even want to tip them. The palak paneer, chicken tikka masala were not only bland but almost downright inedible. I went to the actual place itself and ordered it fresh and was still disappointed. The service has been a bit fast paced and would most certainly intimidate the average Indian food novice. Price wise, not so bad and I figure very few would order if the price were not favorable. Even the most forgiving Indian tastebuds may not be able to forgive this place. <summary> Based on the provided customer reviews, here are some actionable insights for the restaurant:

- **Improve Delivery Times:**
  - Many customers have experienced slow delivery, with waits over an hour. Efforts should be made to shorten delivery times.

- **Enhance Food Quality:**
  - Customers have reported that dishes such as the palak paneer and chicken tikka masala were bland and almost inedible. Review and improve the seasoning and taste profiles of these menu items.

- **Consistency in Food Quality:**
  - Even when ordering directly at the restaurant, customers were disappointed. This indicates a possible issue with the consistency of food quality that needs to be addressed.

- **Service Speed:**
  - Service is perceived as fast-paced, which may not be appreciated by all customers, especially those not familiar with Indian cuisine. Ensure that the service pace allows for a welcoming and helpful dining experience.

- **Pricing:**
  - The pricing seems acceptable, but improvements in food quality and service may justify any potential price increase and might dissuade customers from ordering if they feel prices are unfavorable given the current experience.

- **Customer Retention:**
  - The current state of service and food quality might not be forgiving for those with a palate for Indian cuisine. It is important to ensure that the overall dining experience meets the expectations of both novice and experienced customers to encourage repeat business.
  
It's essential to act on this feedback to improve the overall customer experience and retention. </summary>"
