"The yogurt was great the first time I went, as well as the staff. The second time would've been just as great except for the fact that I was totally disgusted because there was a roach on the toppings. Very disappointed, something they may have not been able to control but on that note, I probably won't be going back. Sad part is I would've loved some yogurt today too :/ // I've been here many times. The last time I took my family we saw roaches walking all over the toppings and killed a few on the floor while we were just standing there. God knows what was spinning in those machines. There was an A rating in the window. I told the attendant..she just shrugged her shoulders. DISGUSTING!!! DON'T BOTHER. there's another 15 Flavors on E.

"Probably worst food experience I've had in a very long time. I ordered delivery from here. Delivery man - was rude, did not greet me. I said good night and he didn't look at me, he just out the order in my hand and turned around. We had 2 meals the plantain & cheese balls and the fried pargo. Platain cheese balls - big and bland. Needed spices and more cheese. I couldn't finish it because of how bland and dry it was. Friend largo - the fish itself was good, but could have been seasoned more. The rice was good but too much was served. The plantains were again very bland, had no salt or adobo. I would never eat here again, at least not from delivery. <|summary|> - Review the delivery service interaction and ensure delivery personnel are trained in customer service etiquette as the customer experienced rudeness.

"Your prices can vary based on who is the register by $2 to $5 per item. Every time I go here, the prices of the items shift and there is no receipt to validate price.

"Unfortunately, they don't speak English and hang up on you when you call for an order. And hang up on you again. And again for the third time. And after some coaxing from ppl at home to call again, the same person decides to finally say ""Sorry, I don't know English"" and abruptly hangs up again.

"I got delivery from here and it was quite bad. Even most of the expensive rolls were tasteless. The fish was not super-fresh, and the scallop was so shady that I threw it out after tasting. Bad, not fresh, and over-priced = big no. The vanilla mochi were okay, though they were a bit hard to eat. // Went here because it was a little cheaper than other places. Won't make that mistake again. The sushi quality is pretty bad. Doesn't seem fresh at all. The tuna was FULL of Sinew (the white stringy/chewy tissue) which if you anything about sushi, you know it's the worst/cheapest/least fresh cut. The spicy salmon even worse. Even the avocado wasn't fresh which is just a shame. It's worth the extra few cents to go anywhere else in the area. <|summary|> - Improve the quality and taste of the expensive rolls as customers find them tasteless.

"Took like half an hour to get a simple fried chicken sandwich. When I got home, bit in only to find that although I had specifically ordered a chicken breast, it was a thigh and I'd just bitten into bone. Admittedly, it wasn't bad fried chicken, but who orders a chicken thigh sandwich with bone in it? They also forgot to put any tomatoes/lettuce on it. It was just fried chicken and cheese between two slices of store bought wheat bread. The two people who worked there seemed old and confused, like maybe they weren't all there, but very nice. Maybe it's time to hire some younger folks to run the place? <|summary|> - Improve service speed; took too long (half an hour) to serve a simple fried chicken sandwich.
- Ensure order accuracy; a chicken thigh was given instead of the requested chicken breast, and it contained bone.

"I ordered a lamb shish kebab. It turned out to have 6 pieces of lamb meat. And it cost 12dollars! Is this robbery? // I came here and ordered their grilled lamb with rice and salad ($11) to go and after taking my first bite it was nothing but disappointment. My lamb was flavorless and tough, while my parboiled rice was just parboiled rice. My salad was full of onions and the mint dressing was lacking in flavor. Overall, I was left feeling unsatisfied and wished that I did not order from them. Maybe because of my previous experience at other Turkish restaurants, I was expecting more. // The food is average, waiters were nice and friendly. Alot of noise, should have some music in the store. <|summary|> - Consider reviewing the pricing of the lamb shish kebab as a customer felt that receiving only 6 pieces of lamb meat for $12 was not valuable and compared it to robbery.
- Address the quality of the grilled lamb dish as the meat was described as flavorless and tough, and the parboiled rice was plain.

Will not go again // I have been hearing about this place a lot before it open but when I went to try it, let's just say it was a big disappointment. All the hotpot food wasn't even defrost right. The soup base taste like the one you can buy from the supermarket. The only thing I like about here was that the owner was a really friendly. <|summary|> - Review the necessity of a ""VIP customer fee"" for using plates, cups, and chopsticks, as it has caused confusion and dissatisfaction among patrons.

I puked my brains out, had a fever, etc hours after eating the deli food. Definitely eat somewhere else. <|summary|> - Address the peculiar atmosphere mentioned in a review to improve the ambiance; the customer felt a ""weird vibe"" and preferred other local establishments like Jin's or the Spanish bakery.

"This was my second time at this establishment and I wont be coming back. When we first entered, the restaurant was freezing cold to the point where I needed to put back on my parka. As we were then eating our food, we noticed that there was a live bug in one of the rices we were eating. When we called this to their attention, they did apologize, but at the end, only ended up taking the rice off the bill. We were so disgusted we stopped eating the entire meal immediately.

- Reflect on the business model to ensure it properly caters to its clientele, considering feedback about the lounge feeling more like a club due solely to its offering of hookah without alcohol."
"People always say support black businesses, but the black businesses can't give you anything to willingly support. Ordered food from a restaurant simply 10 minutes away from my house at 8:05, call at 9 to check on the order, to be told that they haven't received it but ""oh wait the fax machine was off, let me see, let me add more paper and oh I see the order"" to be told that she would express the order in 25 minutes , it has now been 50 minutes.

I was thirsty and I wanted something to quench my thirst and gotten the watermelon drink, which was $5. To me it was pretty steep for just watermelon juice that wasn't even sweet. It was very bland watermelon juice. I mean I've paid $5 for a drink elsewhere and I get a little more I feel. More as in quality not quantity wise. <|summary|> - Evaluate pricing strategy for drinks as customers feel $5 for a watermelon juice is steep, especially if it's not sweet or high quality.

"I stopped by here for a late lunch. and while the service was all right. The World Cup game was on. Offshore though is a regular diner. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich, and it was really not that good. The meat felt really dry, and the fries were standard diner fries.. so this restaurant is just one of the many choices of Bay Ridge for eating. The price was all right for what I paid for. Which was an even $10, tip included. This was a random place I stopped by, not sure if I'll look for somewhere else to eat next time. // Not a good experience.

"Ordered via Seamless for some sushi on a Saturday. Got the cucumber, avocado and asparagus roll with miso soup (and clear soup for the next day). The roll was good- nothing special but it's also a simple roll in and of itself, so that was to be expected I suppose. When I went to eat my miso soup, however, there was a huge, long black hair in it...gross. There are few things that trigger my gag reflex but hair in food is one of them, especially considering that this soup likely came out if a larger pot that people ate from all night. Just disgusting.

"WASTE OF MONEY AND POTENTIAL FOR FOOD POISONING. It's obvious that the raving reviews here about the restaurant were written either by the owner or friends of the owner. Horrible tasting food and not cheap either. Paid $3 for a paratha that was supposed to have masala inside, waited 20 minutes for it, and ended up being a plain (still bad) paratha worth about 25-50 cents. Paid $7 for sour-tasting chicken tikka masala, graced with lots of oil floating on top of the gravy and chicken. It tasted as though they put pickle in it, but there wasn't so I have no idea why chicken tikka masala was sour. Thank the lord I didn't get food poisoning.

"I am so done with this place. The food is very good but their service sucks. Very rude, they always have attitudes. Clearly don't understand customer service at all. I order from here a lot it wasn't always this bad but I believe the women who does or did all of the cooking isn't there anymore so now it's run by nothing but young hood boys how clearly don't know how to show respect to someone who is supporting your business. Never going back again. But if you don't care about that.. food is good.

I used a debit card to pay for my items, the cost $32. Fine. But when he went to swipe the card, he tells me it didn't go through shows me a torn recipe with no indication that it was declined. I then pay in cash, I check my statements, the amount was fully debited. Not only did he take $32 from my card, he got $32 in has a total of $64 for a salad and some non sense for my child. Never again, they will not rectify this matter. You have been warned. <|summary|> - Improve customer service responsiveness both on the phone and in person.

"Coffee was good. Orange juice that is packaged like it is fresh squeezed is Tropicana I think.

"I was very dis appointed in the food. The chicken was burned and dry almost to the bone. I guess since it was the end of the day I got what was left of old food. The Rica and beans was ok and pit salad. But I paid 15.00 for a meal that was not to my satisfaction. Don't depend on getting a fresh cooked meal at the end of the day delivered to your home. You should mention this when you place your order that you want fresh food not left overs. I am looking at the pic on the website and in no way does it look like the chicken that I received. And there's no price for the potatoe salad. With tip my meal cost me 17 dollars. I won't be offering over the phone ever again. // Do not recommend it.

"So yes, this place sells boba for $1.75, much cheaper than most other establishments in Chinatown and your run of the mill Kung Fu Tea. However, I was absolutely disgusted watching the person making my drink. I asked for an almond boba milk tea with less sugar but the woman making my drink must've misunderstood me because I saw her pour cup after cup of sugar into my drink. Gross that you can see your drink being prepared (ignorance is bliss). In the end I had to just throw most of my drink away because it was overly sweet. I've been here one other time when I got half sugar regular black milk tea and also had the same overly sweet issue, though to a lesser degree. <|summary|> - Offer boba at a competitive price of $1.75, which is cheaper than most establishments in Chinatown.
- Address hygiene concerns by ensuring customers cannot see their drinks being prepared, as one customer was disgusted watching the drink-making process.

"Tried their chicken pesto sandwich. Maybe it was an off day but the chicken was extremely dry. Have had much better at NY Bagel one street away and even, dare I say, panini tozt. // Came here on 08/17/13 and they ""accidentally"" charged $13.75 for a bag of pretzels. Cashier gave me $10 back. The very next day, they again ""accidentally"" charged for a can of Coke. When I asked about why the total was what it was, the dumbfounded cashier started throwing out random prices, which of course didn't tie in with the $16.34 total...then handed me back $3.00. I've been going here for quite a while, but now it's game over. <|summary|> Here's a summary of the customer feedback in bullet points:

- The chicken pesto sandwich was found to be extremely dry, potentially indicating an issue with preparation or ingredient quality on that day.
- Comparison to other establishments (NY Bagel and a place called panini tozt) suggests the customer has had better experiences elsewhere, implying a need for improvement in product quality or uniqueness.
- On 08/17/13, there was an incident where the customer was overcharged $13.75 for a bag of pretzels due to a cashier error. Additionally, a similar overcharging issue occurred the next day with an accidental charge for a can of Coke.
- The cashier did not handle the overcharging incident well, providing inconsistent explanations and seemingly making up prices, leading to further customer frustration with the billing process.
- The customer had been a regular patron but has decided to stop visiting the restaurant due to the recent negative experiences.

Actionable insights for the restaurant owner could include:
- Reviewing and possibly revising the chicken pesto sandwich recipe or its preparation process to ensure consistent quality.
- Investigating and addressing service consistency and competitive positioning given the customer's preference for other local options.
- Improving cashier training to prevent overcharging and ensuring better handling of billing errors.
- Considering implementing a process for quickly and professionally resolving pricing discrepancies to maintain customer trust.
- Reaching out to dissatisfied customers to regain their business, possibly with an apology and an offer to make amends for their poor experience."
"This place is disgusting, hamburger was served cold and French fries tasted old. Service was slow, and the entire experience was poor. I brought my wife and 8 year old for a quick lunch, and we were all dissatisfied with our food. The owner was cursing up a storm, so I would be careful when bringing children here. // The inside is well decorated, peaceful! The service was not up to par. Eggs were great . Fries were soggy. Pancakes tasted like they were re heated in the microwave & when I complained they didn't even ask what I didn't like about it.

"I've been going to this place since 2011... I must say they were amazing before. But recently their lamb noodles SUCK! Lack of flavor and the lamb was dry and the noodle was either under or over cooked. So disappointed! I ate the lamb noodle while growin up in china so I know what it's suppose to taste and that bs they serve now is not it... It used to be so much better. Go to the New World Mall location...

"Noodle Lane. More like Soggy Noodle. These noodles were over cooked mushy and flavorless. No spice. Just bland over cooked noodles. The Bahn Mi was an embarrassment to Bahn Mi.

"Small hole in the wall. Do I want to support it? Yes! Bacon frying on the grill smells great but all I want is an oatmeal. It says homemade oatmeal. Skeptical that they have it I ask and the guy behind the grill says yes. Ok. Great. I stand there waiting... then I see it. The second guy behind the counter pours some hot water on quick dry oats then sticks it in the microwave. To make all this even more offensive they charge me $2.50. For uncooked, gritty, microwaved oatmeal. Yuck. Would've been better off getting it at starbucks... // They are so nice, but sooooo slow at breakfast which is the only time I frequent this deli. The prices are comparable to anything else (2 large coffees and a bialy with butter $4.50), in this area. <|summary|> - Consider making the homemade oatmeal authentically instead of using quick-dry oats and a microwave, especially if it's advertised as homemade.

"Came on a Saturday night and place was pretty busy. Ordered the special squash soup which was good. The rest of it was bad... Service: Our waiter messed up my order, was MIA most of the time. Food: duck confit was too salty. Ordered medium steak frites but came out rare. The experience was bad. Won't go back again. // Awful Service was terrible, food was decent, but service was so slow, poor and rude what should've been a pleasant 2 hour dinner dragged into an annoying 3.5 hour nuisance.

"ordered the chicken tikka masla and it was gross. the meat was uncooked and the rice portion was a small cups worth. bread came cold. had to throw it out it was inedible. // Forgot half of what we prdered. Terribly gross. Little flavor. Very spicy. Would not return. My buddy from Pakistan ordered for us so I don't remember the bands of our dishes. // Is rate the food but the dishonest, unreliable staff was incapable of delivering it to the right address.

"I know I said never again, but Johns is closed on Mondays and I was really craving pizza, so I decided to give them a shot.

"This restaurant is so frustrating. We've had great sushi from here in the past (even when it was Sweethouse). One time about a month ago, we ordered sushi on here through Grubhub on a Thursday and the owner called back to apologize saying they weren't open.

"The worst service and food ever!!!! I have no clue who wrote the previous reviews, probably family and friends of the owners.i have never experienced such terrible food ( soggy salads, fish and meat were NOT fresh, no focus on presentation, drinks were room temperature). The owner was also plain RUDE! For the Russian audience: guys, do you remember a restaurant in the mid 90's called Kalinka, on Kingshighway? Galaxy is even worse Too bad I can't put no star at all.

"I'll keep this short.. but NOT so sweet. My friend & I got an extreme case of the bubble guts after eating there this past Saturday 7/28/2012. I barely made it home & had my poor friend coaching me to ""breathe"" like I was having a baby the whole way home. A little while later, my friend was in the bathroom as well. I used to love this pizza. I had to literally use every seasoning they had & it took adding salt to actually make a difference.

"DEcent Pizza, Grandma is the safest way to go. I got unlucky with the black linguini seafood. Definitely not homemade, pasta was sticky and bland. Don't expect seafood to be sauted together on anchovy butter with the pasta. Sea food was fresh but disconnected from the pasta. Maybe that was my problem because of my high expectations.

"Looks like it's under a new administration; they even changed the name and look of the place. I used to love their food when I first discovered this little gem about 3 months ago. The other day I came in and orders half a chicken, fried yuca and a flan. The flan was amazing, the chicken was okay, the yuca was disgusting! Sooooo sooooo disgusting! And on top of that it took forever to make. It was as if they were rotten or not fried all the way through.

"This place delivered food without the food being sealed, and refused to re-deliver again! Very rude, and Not even sure this place is a Kosher supervision place. // RUDE. I wish I could give this place ZERO stars. From the minute I ordered, the man over the phone was rude to me, not paying attention to me, carrying on conversations with other people while I was on the line, and actually hung up the phone on me before I was done ordering. When I got to the pizza store to pick up my order, there was no sign of my food. He charged me for my pizza, pasta, and salad AND THEN began preparing my food. Ridiculous.

"Not going back again. It took more than 30 mins for our food to come, and the meat was dry and smelled disgusting. How could filet mignon be gamey??? I do not understand. If a chef's special was that bad, I assume everything else would be the same or even worse. Well the service was okay and I liked their mashed potatoes but that was it. // I don't like this restaurant from only one visit. The paella was disgusting. With salchichas and barley any seafood?

"Not the best place to get ecuatorian food. My wife is ecuatorian and misses her national food, but this definetly did not do it for her. First of all, you go inside the place is dark and dank. The waitress was angry and from El Salvador. My wife ordered Guatita, which is lamb stomach with sauce. It is a dish which is usually delicious! They gave us some chewy stomach(it should be more tender usually) and a giant serving of rice. Then they charged us 11 dollars.

"I went here to grab some breakfast after a night out. Wasn't looking for anything fancy, just a nice spot to chill. Although the location is prime (right next to Johnson Library on Main St.), I didn't feel my order was very good. The sausage, egg, and cheese on a bagel I had was sub-par at best, mostly because of the chewy bagel and fake-tasting eggs. And the coffee tasted burnt and off brand. Other reviews say the muffins are great so perhaps next time I'll stick to that. But if you're looking for a decent breakfast sandwich, it would be a good idea to look elsewhere. <|summary|> - Investigate the quality of the bagels, the preparation of eggs, and possibly switch to a better product if confirmation of their subpar condition is found.

"I finally stopped in after passing by many times. My hesitation in trying out this restaurant was the fact that most times it seemed empty. Maybe there is a reason why. The decor inside is outdated and could use quite a bit of help. Overall, the food was underwhelming, especially compared to other UES Thai restaurants. In general all the food was lacking in flavor and spice. My Pad Thai was liquidy at the bottom of the dish and the noodles were undercooked and really chewy. The papaya salad was average. The calamari was bland and the sauce was not much better. I probably will not be coming back anytime soon. FYI it is a BYOB restaurant. <|summary|> - Consider updating the restaurant's decor as it currently appears outdated and might not be attracting customers.

"Waste of 12$. The food was dry, rubbery/hard. I will say that the flavor of the honey lemon chicken was good and the fact that they have a bottle of bourbon sauce at the register was also a good point in their favor. It doesn't change the bad chicken. <|summary|> - Ensure that the chicken dishes maintain proper moisture, avoiding dryness.
- Address the texture issue with any rubbery or hard meats.
- Maintain the flavor quality of the honey lemon chicken, as it received positive feedback.
- Consider highlighting or promoting the availability of bottled bourbon sauce at the register, as it was appreciated by the customer.

"The bad service started when we walked in. We waited two mins before the bar tender simply pointed at a table for us to sit at. After another 10 mins of waiting, the busboy came and asked if tap water was ok. That was the extent of the service we received. We sat at our table for another 20 mins, in which time no one else came and talked to us or took our order. The tap water was also never delivered. After we sat down, two new tables were served water, bread and waiter came over and took their drinks orders. I would have brushed this off to the restaurant being busy, except for the fact that we were the only black customer in the restaurant. Truly sad experience and not a way to run a business. <|summary|> - Address concerns about poor service from the moment customers enter the restaurant.

- Apologies and corrective measures should be considered for the customer to address their 'truly sad experience' and to improve the restaurant's overall customer service reputation."
"Sorry to say but I will never go to this place again. Our credit card number was stolen here. My son used a card that he had not used before, paid for the meal, and within 10 minutes someone in San Francisco used his card number. We were alerted by the credit card company about three hours later but by then already 8 charges had been placed in San Francisco... don't know if it was the help or the restaurant but this was the only place my son used this card. // I ordered oxtail pho. The portions were small. The meat fell off the bone but it was oddly very chewy. Looks are deceiving. The soup is ok, a bit on the sweeter side. The service was nice and quick. Overall, okay restaurant - probably will not be returning. I've had better and cheaper. <|summary|> - Enhance credit card security measures and investigate potential causes of credit card theft, as there was an incident where a customer's card number was allegedly stolen and used shortly after dining at the restaurant.

"Decent food.. You got to be careful late at night.. They try to take advantage of the drunk people, luckily we were sober when they tried their tricks... // i was there 12/11/16 with a party of 15. sorry but i have to let you know there was a ""roach"" in my ice tea!!!!! the owner was rude!! still wanted to charge me!!! i did not pay for my food but i tip the waitress!! she was very understanding i gave her the cup with the roach for proof!!! <|summary|> - Maintain vigilance with late-night customers to prevent potential exploitation of intoxicated guests.

"Went here on Thurs and felt like ""Mr Cellophane"". No only did the waitress forget my soup, but she brought out cold gravy without a spoon. When I had to ask for my check, I knew that I was totally forgotten in my back, faraway place in the room. // Ordered through GrubHub. Usually pretty good, but this time it was TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! Food came spilled out of the box. The food that was intact didn't have the cheese that we paid extra for. I WANTED MY EXTRA CHEESE! The delivery guy came back to come pick it up for some reason... I hope they don't serve it to anyone else! The service of the lady that answered the phone was disgusting and so rude. WATCH OUT! <|summary|> - Improve staff attentiveness, ensuring they regularly check on customers to avoid situations where guests feel ignored or forgotten (""felt like 'Mr. Cellophane'"").

"Please! Do not go here. The owner or whatever is so rude to customers. And the employees were begging for the tip. The place is soooooooo dirty and the restroom... Smells like poop and pee. Ewwww i almost threw up when i entered the bathroom. I do not even want to give a star. // Wow this place has changed and I dont like any of the ""improvements."" I went there 3 times and each time I went there, I left very unsatisfied. The cook must have changed because the food was lacking. It was either too greasy, no flavor and the food was just barely edible. The old dora dora was much better in every aspect. <|summary|> Based on the customer reviews provided, here are some actionable insights for the restaurant owner:

- Address the rudeness issue: Customers have reported the owner or staff acting rudely. Measures should be taken to improve customer service and the overall attitude towards patrons.

"Benjamin's Corner has provided countless Columbia students with convenient access to cold beverages, hot coffee, assorted pastries, and hot sandwiches to fuel their frenetic schedules at prices cheaper than the school cafes. I don't recommend the hot food here, however, because it takes far too long compared to other food carts and neighboring restaurants. For a little more money, one can get more and better hot food at HamDel, a short walk away on Broadway between W. 116th & 115th Streets ( yelp.com/biz/hamilton-de ). <|summary|> - Benjamin's Corner offers convenient access to cold beverages, hot coffee, assorted pastries, and hot sandwiches at prices more affordable than school cafes.

"I would say giving two stars is being generous. We came here because all the other restaurants around were PACKED, and this place was super empty, which in retrospect should have warned us away... Anyway, we were only able to get our appetizer because after waiting an hour, they still couldn't find a way to bring us our entrees. The appetizer wasn't even tasty--we got the octopus and it was excessively chewy and lacked flavor. The celery root pure it was served with had the weirdest texture. We told them we were in a rush but ended up canceling our entrees since they weren't able to bring them to us within the hour. I will say that the service was great.

"It was a crowded food court on a Saturday afternoon and the only seating available was in front of Hottest 86 (or in Chinese, Old Place). So we decided to grab food from there. - Beef over rice: over-salted and oily. Otherwise, cooked well. - Cabbage soup: way over-salted. Like swallowed gulps of ocean water. Not Recommended.

Sent back and the pancakes out some box, Aunt Jemima' ready made taste better, were also overcooked. I complained and the manager had the nerve to say they were fine and come like that. I guess he's oblivious to Yelp. Should have gotten the gist when walking into an empty place at peak time. Stay away. // Came here for breakfast with my son. The pancakes were horrible.

"I am happy to see that such exotic cuisine is available to experience. I was not impressed though. The quality of food was not what I had expected. Getting takeout was a challenge when I saw no description of the dishes on the website and when I called in I got a very vague description of what I would be ordering. A friend of mine drove this to me on her journey from NYC and when I opened the package I saw a very different picture than what was described to me. I am all for using all part of the animal and trying new things but what was described to me as simply beef leg turned out to be a cartilage dish. It was shocking to say the last and a better warning and description could have cleared up the confusion. <|summary|> - Consider describing dishes more accurately both on the website and when providing explanations over the phone to match customer expectations.

"Guess i'm gonna upset a lot of people. First time trying this place after the NJ.com rating and recommendations from a friend. This review is strictly for their ""Combo"" sandwich for $9. This was one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had. Bread was hard, cold cuts were bland (they had Boar's Head on display) doubt i was given Boar's Head. The green & red peppers were stale (had an foul/bitter taste).The Mozzarella was the only part that was decent. Quantity of meats were so-so (see pic) Ended up throwing away most of the sandwich. No idea what happened, but i'm just stating my experience. <|summary|> - The customer was disappointed with the ""Combo"" sandwich that was priced at $9.
- Complaints about the sandwich include hard bread and bland cold cuts, with suspicions that the advertised Boar's Head brand was not actually used.
- The green and red peppers were stale and had a foul/bitter taste.
- The mozzarella cheese was the only component of the sandwich that was considered decent.
- There was an issue with the quantity of meats provided, which the customer found unsatisfactory.
- The customer ended up throwing away most of the sandwich.
- There is confusion about what went wrong as the customer had high expectations based on NJ.com ratings and friend recommendations.

Actionable Insights:
- Review sandwich recipes, ensuring that all bread is fresh and appropriately soft for serving.
- Investigate the quality and presentation of cold cuts to confirm they meet the standards, especially if Boar's Head is advertised.
- Check the freshness of vegetables like peppers regularly to ensure they are not stale or foul-tasting.
- Ensure that the quantity of meat in the sandwiches is sufficient and meets customer expectations.
- Address the discrepancy between the customer's disappointing experience and the positive ratings/recommendations that might have led to their initial visit.
- Gather more feedback to determine if this is an isolated incident or a recurring issue that needs immediate rectification."
"Have been here a few times, as it's close to my house. The counter staff is always really, really rude, barely looking up from their phones, not bothering to hand you back change or a receipt. The food is pretty good, but the prices are high and portions are small. The service is the deal breaker for me, though: I don't want to give my business to a store that's not interested in acknowledging it. <|summary|> - Address customer service issues at the counter, including staff rudeness and inattentiveness (e.g., looking at their phones instead of interacting with customers).
- Improve staff training to ensure that customers receive receipts and correct change promptly.
- Evaluate pricing and portion sizes to ensure they deliver good value for money, as the current perception is that prices are high and portions are small.
- Consider customer engagement strategies to show patrons that their business is valued and their presence is acknowledged."
"This review is more about the customer service-which was horrible- than about the food, which was okay. If you see this restaurant offer a deal here on Yelp or on any other site: buyer beware. I bought the deal here on Yelp: $6 for $15 worth of food. They did not honor the deal, only gave me a $9. discount (because they had to recoup the $6 I paid for the deal???) Then claimed even after they called the manager that they had no knowledge of what yelp even was, and they had certainly never signed up for a deal. I'm still waiting for yelp to give me my $6 back. It's not a lot of money but right is right. <|summary|> Here are the actionable insights from the customer reviews:

- Address issues in customer service as it received negative feedback, described as ""horrible.""
- Evaluate the food offerings since the review says the food was ""okay""; there might be room for improvement.
- Ensure all promotional offers, like deals posted on Yelp or any other sites, are honored as advertised to maintain credibility and trust with customers.
- Train staff to be familiar with ongoing promotions and how to process them to avoid confusion and customer dissatisfaction.
- Investigate the discrepancy with the promotional deal where the customer received only a $9 discount instead of the advertised $15 worth of food for $6.
- Look into the claim that the management was not aware of the Yelp deal and reportedly had not agreed to such a promotion.
- Ensure communication channels are open and responsive, particularly with regards to refund requests, and to resolve them promptly to maintain customer trust.
- Uphold ethical practices, especially concerning the sentiment that ""right is right,"" implying that the customer expects fair treatment regardless of the amount of money involved."
"They barely speak English so it was kind of a turn off. Ordered the bibimbap and somehow they forgot to put the beef in it. I told her and all she did was grab some chopped pork and poured it on top. I've had bibimbap at many Korean restaurants before and this one was by far the worst. There was absolutely no flavor to it. Korean food is known to be flavorful and this was such a disappointment. No wonder why there was no one else in there eating. Better off spending the time driving to fort lee to find good delicious Korean food. <|summary|> - Language Barrier: Staff may need better training in English to improve communication with customers.
- Incorrect Orders: Ensure orders are double-checked before serving, particularly for key ingredients in dishes like beef in bibimbap.
- Quality of Food: The bibimbap was not up to par with other Korean restaurants; concentrate on enhancing the flavor profile of traditional dishes.
- Customer Experience: The overall customer experience was disappointing, perhaps contributing to low patronage at the time of their visit.
- Competition: Consider the level of quality and authenticity other nearby Korean restaurants are providing, and strive to meet or exceed that standard.
- Facility Utilization: Investigate reasons for low customer turnout and develop strategies to attract more patrons, possibly through marketing or improvements to the dining experience. 

Consider immediate improvements to address these issues and potentially reevaluate the menu and service standards to ensure customers leave satisfied."
