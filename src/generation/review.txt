If you decide to eat here, just be aware it is going to take about 2 hours from beginning to end. We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it's other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience.

The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.

Jones is definitely average quality, not many complaints, but nothing to really rave over either. We went as a group of five with a reservation so we didn't have to wait long for a table. They have a limited menu during certain times, so be careful of that. It was very busy and loud, but this wasn't an issue for us. We would go back if there weren't any other options, but considering the area, there are many other better options.

We tried this place on our first trip to New Orleans! It was super cute, first of all. The service was friendly and the food was amazing! I ordered the traditional Benedict and it was the best I have had. We will definitely be coming back for breakfast/brunch again on this trip.

My boyfriend and I went for the "bubbly" wine tasting this past weekend for a little Valentines celebration. We had a great time and hope to go back again for more! The location is great, right on Market street. For the wine tastings they have a small area set up in the downstairs of the building, which was pleasant and intimate!

There man who led the class was great, knowledgeable and very friendly. While we didn't like all of the wines tasted, that's the point, so no harm no foul there! We both cannot wait to go back again, seeing as it was Very affordable.

Not a bad Dunkin Donuts, but certainly not the best one. In the morning when I have been for coffee, the staff is always efficient and friendly. However, if you go anytime after breakfast, the service is by far slower and less friendly. I understand that this is due to the morning rush, but some of us work different hours and are on different schedules and would still appreciate fast service.

Overall, the coffee orders I have always asked for have been correct and I just know to allot more time if visiting later on in the day.

So glad we stumbled upon this restaurant! It is cute, decorated nicely, clean, and the food is very good!

We moved recently and this place has been a great find for noodles, dumplings and even some classic chinese food options! Their soup dumplings and fried rice noodles are my go to! We have eaten in and done take out a few times, both were quick and delicious.

I was looking forward to a romantic dinner here, as I was here for a Christmas party years ago and loved it. Tonight was slightly disappointing, however.

Pros:
The staff was very friendly, they had a huge wine list, and the table-side salad was the highlight of the meal for sure!

Cons:
Perhaps we just ordered the two bad things from the menu but the scallops (sandy and fishy) and duck were nothing to rave about. I am never one to complain to the staff, and as I was full from the bread and the salad I didn't make a huge deal about being unhappy with dinner. I knew they saw we hardly touched our food and we're attentive, but we just wanted to leave. I'm sure other items on the menu are good, but for the same price point we have enjoyed many meals elsewhere. I wish I would have enjoyed it, seeing all the positive reviews it did have on yelp.

Humpty's Dumplings is one of the highlights of living in this area! It's in a great location and reasonably priced too! Don't miss Hump Day (Wednesday) for a dollar a dumpling! (7 dollars for 5 any other day).

Some of my recommendations off their savory menu would have to be their cheesesteak and roasted pork dumplings.

They also have sweet dessert dumplings like cheesecake and apple pie! Their dessert menu seems to rotate in and out so it's a bit of a surprise when you get there.

This will definitely be one of the most missed places when I graduate and leave the area!

We moved to this area recently and have been looking for decent Chinese take-out since. While this wasn't the worst we have tried, I did not care for the shrimp or chicken, the search continues.
----end----
This place is always packed! Which is just the side effect of having great barbecue, great employees, and a great overall vibe. No matter how busy or crowded, every time I have eaten in or got takeout, it never felt like a chore. Staff is always friendly and helpful, making the experience great!

We have ordered ribs, pulled pork and chicken, and pretty much all of the sides at this point, and have enjoyed each item! Great quality, and great service all around.

Average pizza and food, especially considering all of the other pizza options in south jersey. It's always busy however, most likely due to the location and service. I have never had an issue with my order, but it is also not my first choice. They have a convenient pick up window, and also offer delivery which is helpful.
----end----
We like this place because of its convenience and the fact that they carry our dog's food which can be difficult to find sometimes. It is very clean and organized as well.

The only downside is the staff can be a little pushy. It can be frustrating to get a lot of lectures about things that don't apply to my already very well kept and healthy dog.
----end----
Super clean, very friendly employees, and a nice overall environment. My manicures and pedicures from here have all lasted and been done well!
----end----
Good local hoagie shop! No real complaints, and it comes in handy for a quick lunch. I have really high hoagie standards growing up in south Jersey, and Primos is usually a good choice!
----end----
This place is all about the experience! While, yes there is usually a wait and the store is small, I didn't find this very off putting. I heard people complaining about these facts, guess you can't make everyone happy. I mean, how bad could it possibly be if you're getting ice cream?!

They have a variety of set flavors, but definitely something for everyone. Topping are included and the product is obviously made in front of you, adding to the fun experience. I would definitely go back, and I recommend people give it a try for a fun and unique treat!

Jules is a great option for healthy, yummy pizza! I got the pizza "flights" which allow you to try up to four slices at a time.

I highly recommend "Kim's pie" and the classic plain pizza as well. They have great thin crust and fresh toppings! Definitely coming back for more in the future!
----end----
Love that I was able to find a restaurant that makes the traditional Lebanese foods that I grew up eating! The chicken shawarma and kafta are delicious and I would highly recommend! I was also so excited to find out they make my favorite dessert; kanefah! If you get the chance, you have to try it here!
----end----
Great option for easy, fast, yummy and affordable pizza! Not only do they have many pre-made options, you can create your own to your liking (always a great option). They have such a wide variety of toppings, so no matter you prefer, you can find something delicious here!
----end----
Very good sushi at a really good price! Ninja is a trendy cool environment with really delicious sushi rolls. They have a ton of options, but there is usually a little bit of a wait for a table. Very much worth it though!

We recently tried this restaurant, after buying a house in Telford and looking for good local places. We love Mexican food and we're excited to try this spot.

The service was pretty friendly, no complaints there. It was reasonably priced as well.

The food was okay. We both got enchiladas, and after having so many good enchiladas at other authentic Mexican places, we were a little disappointed. It wasn't bad, but also nothing special either.

The menu also had a lot of American-type food (burgers, chicken wings, etc.).
----end----
My absolute favorite pizza shop in the area! I personally love sweet sauce and crust on the thinner side, and Franzones is perfect for it. Probably the only pizza that I could more than three slices of in one sitting.

Came to Margaritas on Tuesday for "happy hour" with some coworkers after seeing the all you can eat tacos advertised driving by. The restaurant itself is cute, great decor and thematic.

The margarita I had was good, however it was only upon ordering it that I learned that sitting and ordering a margarita was a different price than ordering the same one at the bar. This was strange, seeing as our server did not inform us of this, but rather told a coworker who ordered the cheaper one at the bar that she was not allowed technically to do that and then sit down with us. It was strange that happy hour deals were not restaurant wide, and a little annoying that just because we wanted to sit and chat after work rather than stand at the bar we got charged more.

The soft shell tacos themselves were good, but could have used a bit more toppings. Sour cream cost extra, and you only got beans and rice with the first order of tacos (which was a considerably small portion). It seemed that the waiter was just not happy with having a large party ordering things that were discounted and trying to save a couple bucks, thinking people wouldn't leave a large tip because we asked for separate checks. It came across very rude, and I know everyone in the group would have (and did anyway) gave large tips regardless.

Keswick Tavern is a go to if you're looking for great food and large alcohol/beer selection. Their wings are amazing and they have a lot of options for sauces to go with them! Not to mention, many specials such trivia on Wednesday's and a DJ after 11 on Friday nights. I've been going regularly for dinner and drinks since moving to the area and have yet to be disappointed!
----end----
One of the best Indian restaurants in the area! I have been multiple times and continue to come back for more!

Upsides: great food, friendly staff, BYOB, and affordable

Downside: parking in ambler can be a bit of a hassle on weekends and nights!
----end----
I used to be a fan of Iron Hill, but my last couple trips have just been mediocre. The beer is just okay; of the four on my "beer flight," I only liked one of them. The food is also just okay, and service was decent. I ordered the teriyaki chicken and my boyfriend had pasta. We both agreed that we would not come back if given the choice. It is always packed, but I myself do not understand the hype. We will continue to go back to our favorite local spots (not chains).

We have a three month old bichon-shih tzu mix puppy, so I was nervous about where to take him for his first grooming. My neighbor actually recommended Robbyes since they have a Maltese they take there regularly and are happy with them.

 I called and they were able to get me an appointment the following day. They weren't sure how much they would be able to do for his first grooming, but when I picked him up he looked great! Everyone was so friendly and they said he was great for his first time! Glad to have found a go to groomer on the first try!

This is easily the best diner in Glenside! Great and clean atmosphere. The food is classic diner food with middle eastern and Mediterranean choices as well.

The owner is very friendly and inviting, and we have had some nice conversations every time we've gone. The very friendly guy who always buses the tables is great also, super friendly vibe! We definitely make it our regular spot when we are looking for Sunday morning breakfast!
----end----
Happy hour every weekday from 4:30-6:30 is a must! (7$ big azz margaritas)! They make a darn good margarita too! My friends and I try to come weekly to enjoy dinner and margaritas after a long week!

There is a great, fun atmosphere and the servers are always friendly too! Super casual but the food has yet to disappoint. I always go for an enchilada but I hear the wings (which are half price during happy hour) are delicious as well. Will definitely keep coming back for more and recommending to friends and family!
